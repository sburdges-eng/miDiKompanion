# Mixing Workflow Checklist

## Pre-Mix Setup

- [ ] All tracks recorded and edited
- [ ] Session organized (tracks named, colored, grouped)
- [ ] Reference tracks imported
- [ ] Fresh ears (take a break before starting)

---

## Session Organization

### Track Naming Convention
```
01_Kick
02_Snare
03_HiHat
04_Toms
05_OH_L
06_OH_R
10_Bass_DI
11_Bass_Amp
20_GTR_Rhythm_L
21_GTR_Rhythm_R
22_GTR_Lead
30_Keys
40_Vox_Lead
41_Vox_Harm1
42_Vox_Harm2
50_FX
```

### Color Coding
- 🔴 Red: Drums
- 🟠 Orange: Bass
- 🟡 Yellow: Guitars
- 🟢 Green: Keys/Synths
- 🔵 Blue: Vocals
- 🟣 Purple: Effects/Aux

### Track Stacks (Submixes)
- ALL DRUMS → Drum Bus
- ALL BASS → Bass Bus
- ALL GUITARS → Guitar Bus
- ALL VOCALS → Vocal Bus
- ALL MUSIC → Music Bus (everything except vocals)

## Mixing Order

### 1. Static Mix (No Plugins)
- [ ] Balance faders only
- [ ] Set rough panning
- [ ] Get it 80% there with just volume

### 2. Fix Problems (Subtractive)
- [ ] High-pass filter everything that doesn't need low end
- [ ] Cut problem frequencies (mud, harshness)
- [ ] Remove resonances

### 3. Enhance (Additive)
- [ ] Add presence where needed
- [ ] Gentle boosts for character
- [ ] Saturation for warmth

### 4. Dynamics
- [ ] Compress for control (not loudness)
- [ ] Transient shaping if needed
- [ ] Parallel compression for punch

### 5. Space & Depth
- [ ] Reverb sends (short, medium, long)
- [ ] Delay throws
- [ ] Stereo width

### 6. Automation
- [ ] Vocal rides
- [ ] Effect throws
- [ ] Section dynamics

### 7. Mix Bus
- [ ] Gentle glue compression
- [ ] Tonal balance check
- [ ] Limiting for preview only

## Frequency Cheat Sheet

| Range | Name | What Lives Here |
|-------|------|-----------------|
| 20-60 Hz | Sub | Kick fundamental, bass sub |
| 60-200 Hz | Bass | Bass body, kick punch |
| 200-500 Hz | Low-mid | Mud zone, body |
| 500 Hz-2 kHz | Mid | Vocal presence, guitar body |
| 2-6 kHz | Upper-mid | Presence, clarity, harshness |
| 6-12 kHz | High | Air, sibilance, cymbals |
| 12-20 kHz | Air | Sparkle, breath |

---

## Common Problems & Solutions

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Muddy mix | HPF everything, cut 200-400 Hz |
| Harsh vocals | Cut 2-4 kHz, de-esser |
| No punch | Transient shaper, parallel compression |
| Thin guitars | Add 200 Hz, layer tracks |
| Buried vocals | Cut competing frequencies in other tracks |
| No depth | Use reverb/delay, automate levels |

## Before Bounce Checklist

- [ ] Check in mono (phase issues?)
- [ ] Check at low volume
- [ ] Check on different speakers/headphones
- [ ] A/B against reference
- [ ] Take a break and listen fresh
- [ ] Export stems for mastering

---

## Export Settings

### Mix Bounce
- Format: WAV
- Bit Depth: 24-bit
- Sample Rate: Same as session (48kHz typical)
- Normalize: OFF
- Headroom: -3 to -6 dB peak

### Stems
- Same settings as above
- Export each bus separately
