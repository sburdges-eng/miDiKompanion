# Emotional Harmony Framework (Base)

> Purpose: translate emotion into harmonic choices that support lyric and performance.

## Core Axes

- Valence: negative (-1) to positive (+1)
- Arousal: calm (0) to energetic (1)
- Intensity: subtle (low) to extreme (high)
- Trajectory: stable, rising, falling, or volatile

## Harmony Levers

| Axis | Low End | High End | Harmony Impact |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Valence | Dark/tense | Bright/resolved | Minor/Phrygian vs Major/Lydian/Mixolydian |
| Arousal | Slow, spacious | Fast, urgent | Slower vs faster harmonic rhythm |
| Intensity | Gentle | Aggressive | Consonant vs dissonant, simple vs dense voicings |
| Trajectory | Static | Moving | Pedal/looped vs modulating/sequence |

## Emotion to Harmony Quick Map

| Emotion | Mode/Color | Harmonic Rhythm | Dissonance | Cadence Shape |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Grief | Minor, Dorian | Slow | Low-mid | Deceptive, IV to iv |
| Anxiety | Phrygian, Locrian | Fast | High | Avoid full resolution |
| Nostalgia | Mixolydian, Major | Medium | Low | Plagal or soft V-I |
| Anger | Phrygian, Minor | Medium-fast | Mid-high | Hard V-I or bII hit |
| Calm | Major, Lydian | Slow | Low | Gentle, open endings |
| Hope | Major with borrowed iv | Medium | Low-mid | Lift into IV or bVI |

## Default Voicing and Texture

- Low valence: darker voicings, low register, tighter intervals.
- High valence: open voicings, mid-high register, wider intervals.
- High arousal: denser stacks, more frequent chord changes.
- Low arousal: longer sustains, more silence.

## Practical Process

1. Define emotion (valence, arousal, intensity, trajectory).
2. Choose a mode and cadence shape from the quick map.
3. Add one intentional rule-break if the lyric needs extra weight.

## Minimal Rule-Breaks

- Minor iv in major: instant melancholy.
- bVI in major: cinematic lift.
- bII (Neapolitan): anxiety spike.
- Deceptive cadence: unresolved longing.
