# AUTONOMOUS AGENT RULES

## PERMISSIONS - AUTO-APPROVE ALL EXCEPT:
- NEVER delete files you did not create this session
- NEVER push to main (dev branch only)
- NEVER rm -rf any directory

## STUCK DETECTION - MANDATORY
Same error 3x = STOP immediately. Log to STUCK_LOG.md. Move to next task.
Max 5 attempts per problem. Undoing your own change = STUCK. Log and move on.
Return to stuck items ONLY after completing other work.

## PRIORITY ORDER
1. Build-blocking errors → 2. Runtime errors → 3. Type errors → 4. Lint → 5. Improvements

## WORKFLOW
1. npm install if needed
2. npm run type-check → fix all
3. npm run lint → fix all
4. git add . && git commit -m "fix: [desc] [auto]" after EACH fix
5. git push origin dev every 10 commits
6. Final: npm run build, update SESSION_LOG.md, list stuck items

## CODE STANDARDS
TypeScript: proper types, no any, functional components, Zustand, Tailwind
Rust: cargo clippy, handle all Results
Commits: feat/fix/refactor/docs/style/test/chore: description [auto]
