# Knowledge Base

This directory contains the generated knowledge base from repository analysis.

## Structure

- **unified_systems.json** - All unified systems (components that work together)
- **shared_components.json** - Components shared across multiple pipelines
- **pipelines/** - Pipeline-specific knowledge bases
  - **plugins/** - Plugin components, systems, and UI/UX
  - **daw/** - DAW components, systems, and UI/UX
  - **standalone/** - Standalone app components, systems, and UI/UX
- **topics/** - Content organized by topic (production, theory, ml_ai, etc.)

## Usage

The knowledge base is generated by the `daiw-kb-analyzer` Docker service.

To regenerate:
```bash
docker-compose run --rm daiw-kb-analyzer
```

## Pipeline-Specific Knowledge

Each pipeline has its own directory with:
- **components.json** - All components for that pipeline
- **systems.json** - Unified systems for that pipeline
- **ui_ux/components.json** - UI/UX components and patterns

## Shared Components

Components used across multiple pipelines are documented in `shared_components.json` with:
- Which pipelines use them
- Benefits of the overlap
- File locations
