adequately compensated by an award of monetary damages, and in the event of 
such threatened or actual unauthorized use MeldaProduction shall be entitled 
to an injunctive order appropriately restraining and/or prohibiting such 
unauthorized use without the necessity of MeldaProduction posting bond or
