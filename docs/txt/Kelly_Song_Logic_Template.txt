NOTES:
----------------------------------------------
"Shea butter. Still warm in your hair."
  - Full stop after "Shea butter"
  - Let it sit for one beat
  - The body remembers

"I hit the floor. I hit the floor."
  - Same inflection both times
  - Grief loops. Didion's repetition.

Final three lines:
  - Flat as possible
  - No elaboration
  - Just the truth, finally said

For Kelly.
