## CRITICAL MATCHING RULES

### ✅ CORRECT Matching:
- SYSCO "Black Pepper Fine" = Shamrock "Black Pepper Fine" ✓
- SYSCO "Garlic Powder" = Shamrock "Garlic Powder" ✓

### ❌ INCORRECT Matching:
- SYSCO "Black Pepper Fine" ≠ Shamrock "Black Pepper Coarse" ✗
- SYSCO "Garlic Powder" ≠ Shamrock "Garlic Granulated" ✗

## Different Grinds Have Different Uses:

| Grind | Mesh Size | Use Case | Visual |
|-------|-----------|----------|--------|
| **Fine/Table** | 16-20 mesh | Table shakers, smooth sauces | Like table salt |
| **Restaurant/Medium** | 12-14 mesh | All-purpose cooking | Like kosher salt |
| **Coarse** | 8-10 mesh | Steaks, rubs, visible texture | Like breadcrumbs |
| **Cracked** | 4-6 mesh | Marinades, visual appeal | Visible chunks |

## Action Items:

1. **Pull Current Order Guides**
   - [ ] Download SYSCO current price list
   - [ ] Download Shamrock current price list
   - [ ] Note date of price lists

2. **Create Match List**
   ```
   SYSCO Code | SYSCO Description | Shamrock Code | Shamrock Description | Match? (Y/N)
   ```

3. **Products That DON'T Match**
   - List products only SYSCO carries
   - List products only Shamrock carries
   - Note quality differences even if names match

4. **For Each Matched Product Calculate:**
   - Price per pound (both vendors)
   - Savings percentage
   - Monthly usage estimate
   - Monthly savings potential

## Questions to Answer:

1. Does Shamrock carry ALL the black pepper grinds you use?
2. Are there quality differences between vendors' products?
3. Which products have NO equivalent at the other vendor?
4. Are there minimum order quantities that affect pricing?
5. Do you get better pricing than the published rates?

## Email Parser Configuration:

Once we have accurate matches, set up email parsing to:
- Auto-capture both vendors' order confirmations
- Match products by BOTH code AND description
- Flag when prices change
- Alert when savings opportunities exceed 20%
- Track actual purchases vs. optimal vendor selection

## Expected Savings (Based on Accurate Matching):

If black pepper products truly match grind-for-grind:
- Black Pepper (all grinds): ~$45/lb savings (92% cheaper at Shamrock)
- Garlic Powder: ~$2.80/lb savings (24% cheaper at Shamrock)
- Garlic Granulated: ~$30/lb savings (92% cheaper at Shamrock)
- Onion Powder: ~$23/lb savings (94% cheaper at Shamrock)

**Monthly Savings Estimate:** $1,500-2,000 (depending on usage and accurate matching)

## Final Note:

The savings are REAL, but only if we're comparing identical products. A coarse grind at one vendor cannot replace fine grind at another - they serve different culinary purposes.
