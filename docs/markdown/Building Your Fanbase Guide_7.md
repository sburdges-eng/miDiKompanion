# Building Your Fanbase

Growing an audience for your music from zero.

---

## The Foundation

**Truth:** You don't need millions of fans. You need TRUE fans.

**1,000 True Fans concept:**
- 1,000 people who will buy anything you make
- Can support a creative career
- Quality over quantity

---

## Who Is Your Audience?

### Define Your Ideal Listener

**Ask yourself:**
- What genre do they love?
- How old are they?
- Where do they hang out online?
- What other artists do they follow?
- What do they care about?

**Why this matters:** You can't reach "everyone." Target your people.

### Find Your Niche

**General:** "I make pop music"
**Specific:** "I make dreamy bedroom pop for introverts who grew up on 90s alternative"

The more specific, the easier to find your audience.

## The Content Game

### What to Share

**Music (obviously):**
- Finished songs
- Demos and works-in-progress
- Covers
- Snippets and teasers
- Live performances

**Behind the scenes:**
- Writing sessions
- Studio time
- Gear and setup
- Process and struggles
- Creative decisions

**Personal:**
- Your story and journey
- Things you care about
- What inspires you
- Day-to-day life (relevant bits)

**Value:**
- Tips for other musicians
- Playlist recommendations
- Thoughts on music

### Content Ratio

A rough balance:
- 60% entertainment/value
- 30% behind-the-scenes/personal
- 10% "asks" (stream this, buy this)

**Don't just promote.** Give first, ask later.

## Platform Strategy

### Choose Your Focus

**Pick 1-2 primary platforms:**
- Go deep, not wide
- Master before expanding
- Where does YOUR audience live?

### Platform Breakdown

| Platform | Best For | Content Type |
|----------|----------|--------------|
| TikTok | Discovery, virality | Short video, trends |
| Instagram | Visual brand, community | Reels, stories, posts |
| YouTube | Long-form, discoverability | Music videos, vlogs, tutorials |
| Twitter/X | Conversation, personality | Thoughts, engagement |
| Spotify/DSPs | The music itself | Songs, playlists |

### Platform Tips

**TikTok:**
- Hook in first 1-2 seconds
- Trending sounds help
- Behind-the-scenes works
- Consistency over polish

**Instagram:**
- Reels for reach
- Stories for connection
- Quality visual aesthetic
- Engage in DMs and comments

**YouTube:**
- Search optimization matters
- Thumbnails and titles crucial

## Growth Strategies

### Consistency

**Show up regularly:**
- Daily if possible (even small posts)

- Don't disappear for months
- Algorithm rewards consistency

### Engagement

**Talk to people:**

### Collaboration

**Work with others:**

- Playlist swaps
- Shoutouts

**Everyone wins** when you support each other.

### Playlist Pitching

**For Spotify/streaming:**

- Create your own playlists (and include your songs)

### Local Scene

**Don't forget IRL:**
- Play local shows
- Open mics
- Collaborate with local artists
- Build community where you are

## Converting Listeners to Fans

### The Funnel

1. **Discovery:** They find you (algorithm, referral, search)
2. **Listen:** They check out your music

5. **Superfan:** They buy, support, evangelize

## Email List

### Why Email Matters

- Best conversion for sales

### Building Your List

**Offer something valuable:**

- Behind-the-scenes material

**Make it easy:**
- Link in bio
- Pop-up on website
- Mention in content

### What to Send

- New release announcements
- Show dates

- Personal notes
- Exclusive offers

**Don't spam.** 1-2 emails per month is fine.

## Measuring Growth

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Only posting when you release | Post consistently, even between releases |
| Only promoting yourself | Add value, engage with others |
| Ignoring engagement | Reply to everyone, build relationships |
| Trying to be everywhere | Focus on 1-2 platforms |
| Comparing to others | Run your own race |
| Buying followers/streams | Never. It kills your account. |
