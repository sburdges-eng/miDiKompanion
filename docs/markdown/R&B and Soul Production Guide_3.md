## The R&B Sound

Key elements:

- **Rich harmony** — Extended chords, jazz influence
- **Expressive vocals** — Runs, ad-libs, emotion
- **Deep bass** — Groove-focused low end
- **Texture** — Keys, pads, subtle layers

---

## R&B Drums

### The Groove

**Characteristics:**
- Behind the beat (laid back)
- Swing/shuffle feel
- Ghost notes essential
- Not too busy
- Pocket over power

### Programming R&B Drums

**Timing:**
- Quantize: 55-75% (loose)
- Swing: 55-65%
- Snare: 20-40ms LATE
- Hi-hats: Can be on grid or slightly late

**Velocity:**
- Ghost notes: 25-45
- Main hits: 80-110
- Dynamic variation throughout

### Basic Pattern

```
Kick:  1   +   2   +   3   +   4   +
       X           X   X           
Snare:         X               X      (behind beat)
Hats:  x   x   x   x   x   x   x   x  (with ghost notes)
```

### Hi-Hat Patterns

**16th note patterns common:**
- Velocity variation (accents on downbeats)
- Open hats on "ands"
- Not mechanical — humanize

### Drum Sounds

**Classic R&B sounds:**
- Punchy but not aggressive kick
- Cracking snare (not too ringy)
- Crisp hi-hats
- Finger snaps layered with snare
- Subtle percussion (shakers, tambourine)

## R&B Bass

### The Pocket

**Bass is CRUCIAL in R&B:**
- Locks with kick
- Behind the beat (groovy)
- Melodic but supportive
- Not too busy

### Programming Bass

**Timing:**
- 15-30ms behind the beat
- Follows kick pattern mostly
- Occasional fills between phrases

**Tone:**
- Warm, round
- Not too subby (controlled low end)
- Some mid presence for groove

### Bass Techniques

**Slides:**
- Slide into notes
- Pitch bend automation
- Adds expression

**Ghost notes:**
- Muted notes between main hits
- Adds rhythm and groove
- Very quiet (velocity 40-60)

**Octaves:**
- Jump between octaves
- Classic R&B bass move
- Creates movement

## R&B Chords and Harmony

### Extended Chords

**R&B uses LOTS of extensions:**

| Chord Type | Notes | Sound |
|------------|-------|-------|
| Maj7 | 1-3-5-7 | Smooth, dreamy |
| Min7 | 1-b3-5-b7 | Sad, soulful |
| Dom7 | 1-3-5-b7 | Bluesy, tension |
| Min9 | 1-b3-5-b7-9 | Rich, modern |
| Maj9 | 1-3-5-7-9 | Lush, sophisticated |
| 7sus4 | 1-4-5-b7 | Open, suspended |

### Common Progressions

**ii - V - I (Jazz influence):**
```
Dm7 - G7 - Cmaj7
```

**I - vi - ii - V:**
```
Cmaj7 - Am7 - Dm7 - G7
```

**vi - ii - V - I:**
```
Am7 - Dm7 - G7 - Cmaj7
```

**i - IV - VII - III (Neo-soul):**
```
Am7 - Dmaj7 - Gmaj7 - Cmaj7
```

### Chord Voicings

**Don't play block chords:**
- Spread voicings across octaves
- Leave out the root (bass plays it)
- Use inversions
- Voice lead smoothly

---

## R&B Keys

### Electric Piano

**Rhodes/Wurlitzer essential:**
- Warm, bell-like tone
- Velocity-sensitive (bark on hard hits)
- Tremolo effect
- Sits in the mix, not dominant

**Playing style:**
- Chord stabs
- Sustained pads
- Melodic fills between vocal phrases
- Not too busy

### Synth Pads

**Atmospheric layers:**
- Warm, analog-style pads
- Filtered, not bright
- Add depth without dominating
- Slow attack, long release

### Organ

**Gospel/soul influence:**
- Hammond B3 sound
- Sustained chords

## R&B Vocals

### The Sound

**R&B vocals are EXPRESSIVE:**
- Runs and melisma
- Ad-libs
- Falsetto moments
- Emotional delivery
- Breathy or powerful as needed

### Recording Tips

- Capture multiple takes
- Comp the best moments
- Record ad-libs separately
- Layer doubles on chorus

### Processing

**Keep it natural but polished:**
- Light compression (3-4dB)
- De-essing (careful not to over-do)
- Subtle saturation for warmth
- Reverb: Short plate or room
- Delay: Slapback or subtle throws

### Vocal Layers

**Common approach:**
- Lead vocal (center)
- Doubles on chorus (L/R)
- Harmonies (3rds, 5ths)
- Ad-libs (panned, tucked in)
- Vocal chops/samples

---

## Arrangement

### R&B Song Structure

**Typical:**
```
Intro (4-8) → Verse (8-16) → Pre (4-8) → Chorus (8) → 
Verse (8-16) → Pre (4-8) → Chorus (8) → Bridge (8) → 
Chorus (8-16) → Outro (4-8)
```

### Building Dynamics

**Verses:** Stripped back, intimate
**Pre-chorus:** Building
**Chorus:** Fuller, more layers
**Bridge:** Can strip down or build to climax
