## 🔄 HOW THE SYSTEM WORKS TOGETHER

### WORKFLOW:

```
1. BANQUET EVENT BOOKED
   ↓
2. SELECT MENU ITEMS (Passed Food/Buffet/Dessert)
   ↓
3. REFERENCE RECIPE BOOK → Determine ingredient needs
   ↓
4. CHECK SHEET2 (INVENTORY) → See what's in stock
   ↓
5. COMPARE VENDORS (COMBINED GUIDE) → Find best prices
   ↓
6. CREATE ORDER (SHEET1) → Quick order list
   ↓
7. RECEIVE DELIVERY → Update SHEET2 inventory levels
```

### KEY CONNECTIONS:

**Recipe Book ↔ Combined Guide**
- Match recipe ingredients to vendor product numbers
- Example: Recipe calls for "Heavy Cream" → Find product #4218961 (Sysco) or #7182310 (Shamrock)

**Sheet2 ↔ Sheet1**
- Items below PAR level in Sheet2 should be added to Sheet1 order list
- Tracks quantity needed = (PAR level - Current inventory)

**Combined Guide ↔ Ordering**
- Compare Sysco vs Shamrock prices per item
- Select best vendor for each product
- Some items only available from one vendor (noted in guide)

**Storage Locations ↔ Kitchen Operations**
- Sheet2 LOCATION column tells kitchen staff exactly where to find ingredients
- Organized by temperature/storage requirements

## 📈 VENDOR ANALYSIS

### AVAILABILITY:
- **Items from BOTH vendors**: 156 items
  - Can price compare and choose best option
  - Flexibility if one vendor is out of stock
  
- **SYSCO ONLY**: 19 items
  - Must order from Sysco specifically
  
- **SHAMROCK ONLY**: 1 item
  - Must order from Shamrock specifically

### USAGE STRATEGY:
1. For dual-vendor items: Compare prices in Combined Guide
2. For single-vendor items: Note which vendor required
3. Consider delivery schedules/minimums when choosing vendor
4. Build relationship with both vendors for reliability
