# Copyright & Music Rights Guide

Understanding how music ownership and money works.

---

## The Two Copyrights

**Every recorded song has TWO separate copyrights:**

### 1. Composition (The Song Itself)

**What it covers:**
- The melody
- The lyrics
- The chord progression (to some extent)
- The arrangement

**Who owns it:** Songwriters, publishers

**Symbol:** © (for published works)

### 2. Sound Recording (The Master)

**What it covers:**
- The specific recorded performance
- The production
- The sonic elements

**Who owns it:** Usually the artist or label

**Symbol:** ℗ (phonogram)

---

## Who Owns What

### If You Write and Record Alone

**You own:**
- 100% of the composition
- 100% of the master

**You're both songwriter AND recording artist.**

### If You Co-Write

**Composition split depends on agreement:**
- Default: Equal split among writers
- Or: Custom split (agree in writing!)

**Get splits agreed BEFORE release.**

### If You Work with a Producer

**Typically:**
- You own composition (unless they helped write)
- Producer may own % of master
- Or producer gets flat fee + points (%)
- ALWAYS discuss upfront

### If Signed to a Label

**Typically:**
- Label owns masters (or licenses them)
- You keep songwriting (usually)
- Check your contract carefully

---

## Publishing

### What Publishing Is

**Publishing = managing composition rights**

A publisher:
- Collects mechanical and performance royalties
- Pitches for sync opportunities
- Handles administration
- Takes a percentage (usually 15-50%)

### Do You Need a Publisher?

**Full publisher:**
- If you want sync opportunities
- If you can't handle admin
- If they offer advance

**Publishing admin:**
- If you just need collection help
- Services like Songtrust, CD Baby Pro, DistroKid publishing
- They take smaller cut (10-20%)

**Self-publish:**
- If you want to keep everything
- You do all the work
- Okay for starting out

---

## Sync Licensing

### What Is Sync

**Synchronization = music placed with visual media:**
- TV shows
- Films
- Commercials
- Video games
- YouTube videos

### How Sync Works

**Two licenses needed:**
1. Sync license (for composition)
2. Master license (for recording)

**If you own both, you can license both yourself.**

### Getting Sync Placements

**Options:**
- Sync licensing companies
- Music libraries
- Music supervisors (direct)
- Your publisher (if you have one)

**What they look for:**
- High-quality recordings
- Cleared rights (no samples)
- Instrumental versions available
- Professional metadata

---

## Sampling

### Legal Requirements

**To legally use a sample, you need:**
1. Permission from master owner (label/artist)
2. Permission from composition owner (publisher/songwriter)

**Or you'll get sued/your music removed.**

### How to Clear Samples

1. Identify who owns the rights
2. Contact them (or their representatives)
3. Negotiate terms (fee and/or ongoing %)
4. Get it in writing

**Reality:** Clearing samples is expensive and time-consuming.

### Alternatives

- Replay the sample yourself (still need composition clearance)
- Use royalty-free samples
- Create your own sounds
- Some samples are "pre-cleared" (Splice, Tracklib)

---

## Cover Songs

### Streaming Covers

**For streaming platforms:**
- You can cover any song
- Mechanical license is handled by distributor
- Select "cover" when distributing
- Original songwriters get paid

### YouTube Covers

**Content ID may claim your cover:**
- Ad revenue goes to original writers
- Or your video may be blocked
- This is usually okay for exposure

### Live Covers

**Venues handle performance licenses:**
- PROs license venues
- You're covered by venue license
- Special events may need separate license

## Protecting Your Work

### Copyright Automatically Exists

**The moment you create it, you own it.**

You don't HAVE to register, but...

### Why Register (US)

**Benefits of copyright registration:**
- Establishes public record
- Allows you to sue for infringement
- Statutory damages available
- Proof of ownership

**How:** copyright.gov ($45-65 per work)

### Proving Ownership

**Keep records:**
- Dated recordings
- Session files with timestamps
- Lyric sheets
- Collaboration agreements
- Split sheets

---

## Agreements You Need

### Split Sheet

**Agreement between co-writers specifying:**
- Who wrote what percentage
- Publishing designations
- PRO affiliations

**Get this signed before release.**

### Work for Hire Agreement

**When hiring musicians/producers:**
- States they don't own anything
- You own the master
- They get paid flat fee

### Producer Agreement

**When working with producers:**
- Who owns what percentage of master
- Royalty points (if any)
- Credit requirements
- Advance/fee terms

## Common Questions

### "Someone stole my song!"

**Realistically:**
- Coincidences happen (similar melodies)
- Proving theft is extremely difficult
- Legal action is expensive
- Often not worth pursuing

**Prevention:** Release your music, keep records

### "Can I use 30 seconds without permission?"

**No.** There is no "X seconds is okay" rule. Any use requires permission.

### "What if I change 20%?"

**No.** There's no percentage rule. If it's recognizably from another work, you need permission.

### "How do I copyright my music?"

**It's automatically copyrighted when created.** Registration (copyright.gov) is optional but provides legal benefits.
