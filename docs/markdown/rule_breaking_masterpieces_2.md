## 1. HARMONIC RULE-BREAKING

### 1.1 Parallel Fifths and Octaves

**THE RULE (Common Practice Period, 1600-1900):**
- Parallel perfect fifths (P5â†’P5) and octaves (P8â†’P8) between any two voices are forbidden
- Reason: Destroys voice independence; two voices fuse into one perceived line
- In notation: When Voice 1 moves Câ†’D and Voice 2 moves Gâ†’A simultaneously, creating consecutive P5 intervals

**BEETHOVEN - Symphony No. 6 "Pastoral" (1808)**
- *What he broke:* Intentional parallel fifths in the "Storm" movement
- *Notation detail:* Violins and violas moving in parallel P5 motion
- *Why it works:* Creates rustic, folk-like quality; evokes peasant dances and village music
- *Quote:* When questioned about parallel fifths, Beethoven reportedly asked "Well, who has forbidden them?" Upon citation of Fux and others: "Well, I allow them!"

**DEBUSSY - Entire body of work (1890s-1910s)**
- *What he broke:* Systematic use of parallel fifths, fourths, and triads
- *Notation detail:* "Planing" - moving entire triads in parallel motion (e.g., C-E-G â†’ D-F#-A â†’ E-G#-B)
- *Famous example:* "La CathÃ©drale engloutie" - parallel perfect fifths throughout create archaic, medieval atmosphere
- *Why it works:* Deliberately evokes pre-tonal organum; creates impressionistic "wash" of color rather than voice independence

**POWER CHORDS (Rock/Metal, 1960s-present)**
- *What they broke:* Every power chord progression is technically parallel fifths
- *Notation detail:* Root + P5 moving in parallel (e.g., E5â†’A5â†’D5 = E-Bâ†’A-Eâ†’D-A)
- *Why it works:* Intermodular distortion creates additional harmonics from the octave below; parallel motion creates massive, unified sound
- *Key insight:* In distortion context, adding 3rds creates "mud" while P5s remain clear

### 1.2 Polytonality (Multiple Simultaneous Keys)

**THE RULE:**
- Music should establish and maintain a single tonal center
- All harmonies should relate to one key at a time

**STRAVINSKY - "The Rite of Spring" (1913) - "Augurs of Spring" Chord**
- *What he broke:* Superimposed two triads from different keys
- *Notation detail:* Eâ™­7 chord (Eâ™­-G-Bâ™­-Dâ™­) + E major triad (E-G#-B) played simultaneously
- *Spelled out:* Bass plays Eâ™­-Bâ™­-Dâ™­ while upper voices play E-G#-B
- *Interval analysis:* Creates minor 2nd clash between Eâ™­ and E, plus augmented unison between G and G#
- *Why it works:* Neither key "wins" - creates permanent tension; represents primal, pre-tonal chaos
- *Additional example:* Part II opening uses D minor + Eâ™­ minor + C# minor simultaneously

**STRAVINSKY - "Petrushka" (1911) - The "Petrushka Chord"**
- *What he broke:* Bitonal superimposition
- *Notation detail:* C major triad (C-E-G) + F# major triad (F#-A#-C#) = all notes of both triads sounding together
- *Piano reduction splits between hands:* RH plays F# major, LH plays C major
- *Tritone root relationship:* C to F# = 6 semitones (tritone)
- *Why it works:* Represents Petrushka's dual nature (puppet/human); tritone relationship creates maximum tonal distance while sharing no common tones

---

### 1.3 Unresolved Dissonance and Tendency Tones

**THE RULE:**
- Dissonances (7ths, tritones, 2nds) must resolve by step to consonances
- Leading tone (scale degree 7) must resolve up to tonic
- Chordal 7ths must resolve down by step

**THELONIOUS MONK - "Syntactic Dissonance" (1940s-1960s)**
- *What he broke:* Intentionally unresolved "wrong notes" that signify on harmonic norms
- *Notation detail:* Playing notes a semitone below the "correct" note (e.g., Bâ™­ against Bâ™® in melody)
- *Example - "'Round Midnight" (1968 solo):* Deliberate major 2nd dyads (e.g., Bâ™­/Aâ™­) that never resolve
- *Voicing formula:* "Monk voicings" = semitone interval at bottom of chord + 3rd on top
  - Major: 7th, root, 3rd of key (B, C, E in C major)
  - Other chords: 2nd, â™­3rd, 5th of key (D, Eâ™­, G in C melodic minor)
- *Why it works:* "Wrong notes" make sense because they sound wrong in a meaningful way; creates commentary on harmonic expectations

**COLTRANE - "Giant Steps" (1959) - Coltrane Changes**
- *What he broke:* Traditional ii-V-I resolution cycle
- *Notation detail:* Chord roots move by major 3rds instead of 5ths, creating three key centers
  - Original 16 bars contain 26 chord changes
  - Keys cycle: B major â†’ G major â†’ Eâ™­ major (each a major 3rd apart)
- *Specific progression:* B-D7-G-Bâ™­7-Eâ™­-F#7-B...
- *Why it works:* Each V7 resolves to I, but the I immediately becomes a passing tone to the next key; creates "sheets of sound" when improvised over because scales shift every 2 beats

### 1.4 Modal Mixture and Borrowed Chords

**THE RULE:**
- Stay within the diatonic chords of your key
- Major and minor modes should not mix freely

**THE BEATLES - Pervasive â™­VII Usage**
- *What they broke:* Using â™­VII chord in major keys (borrowed from parallel minor/Mixolydian)
- *Notation detail in C major:* Using Bâ™­ major chord instead of B diminished
- *Example - "Norwegian Wood":* I-â™­VII-I progression (E-D-E)
- *Why it works:* â™­VII functions as dominant substitute; Beatles' use helped popularize this in 1960s pop
- *Attributed influence:* Part of increasing popularity of â™­VII in 1960s rock

**RADIOHEAD - Modal Interchange Throughout Catalog**
- *What they broke:* Freely mixing parallel major and minor within single progressions
- *Example - "Creep":* G-B-C-Cm (I-III-IV-iv)
  - B major = borrowed from G Lydian (â™¯IV)
  - Cm = borrowed from G minor (iv)
- *Example - "Everything in Its Right Place":* Oscillates between C majorised Phrygian and F majorised Aeolian
- *Technique:* Pedal notes tie disparate chords together (same note held across all chord changes)
- *Why it works:* Creates characteristic "happy-to-sad" emotional ambiguity

## 2. RHYTHMIC RULE-BREAKING

### 2.1 Irregular and Asymmetrical Meter

**THE RULE:**
- Music should maintain consistent meter
- Strong beats should fall predictably

**STRAVINSKY - "The Rite of Spring" - "Sacrificial Dance"**
- *What he broke:* Constant, unpredictable meter changes
- *Notation detail:* Alternating 2/16, 3/16, 5/16, 2/8, 3/8, 5/8, 7/8 etc.
- *Specific pattern:* Accents create polyrhythms where different looped patterns layer on top of each other
- *"Additive rhythms":* Figures never repeat the same way; notes added and subtracted creating chains of irregular lengths
- *Why it works:* Impossible to predict accent pattern; evokes primitive, pre-civilized ritual chaos

**RADIOHEAD - "Pyramid Song" (2001)**
- *What they broke:* Ambiguous meter that resists classification
- *Notation interpretations from fans:*
  - 12/8
  - 6/8
  - 4/4
  - 3/4 + 5/4 alternating
  - "4 measures of 3/4 + 1 measure of 4/4"
- *Why it works:* Piano chords with no discernible pulse; meter only becomes clear when drums enter, but ambiguity remains central to the piece's unsettled quality

---

### 2.2 Polyrhythm and Metric Displacement

**THE RULE:**
- All voices should share the same metric framework
- Cross-rhythms should resolve to the main pulse

**COLTRANE - "Sheets of Sound" Technique**
- *What he broke:* Played so many notes that they didn't fit into 8th notes, 16th notes, or triplets
- *Notation detail:* Had to group notes in fives and sevens to fit them all in
- *Quote from Coltrane:* "I found there were a certain amount of chord progressions to play in a given time, and sometimes what I played didn't work out in 8th notes, 16th notes or triplets. I had to put the notes in uneven groups like fives and sevens in order to get them all in."
- *Why it works:* Dense cascades of rapid arpeggios create thick, wall-like sonic texture; vertical improvisation tracing chord structures at blistering speeds

---

## 3. VOICE-LEADING RULE-BREAKING

### 3.1 Hidden/Direct Fifths and Octaves

**THE RULE:**
- Two voices should not approach a perfect 5th or 8th by similar motion (both going up or both going down)
- Especially forbidden in outer voices (soprano and bass)

**CHOPIN - Throughout Piano Works**
- *What he broke:* Parallel octaves and fifths in piano textures
- *Observation:* "Beethoven also still respects the rules in 5-voice piano sonatas, but I wouldn't break my head with Liszt and Chopin"
- *Notation context:* In arpeggiated textures (like Etude Op. 25 No. 1), gathering all notes reveals parallel motion, but the temporal displacement disguises it
- *Why it works:* Piano's sustain pedal and rapid figuration mask traditional voice-leading concerns; focus shifts from polyphony to harmonic color

---

### 3.2 Doubled Leading Tones and Tendency Tones

**THE RULE:**
- Never double the leading tone (7th scale degree)
- Never double the 7th of a chord

**COMMON PRACTICE EXCEPTIONS:**
- *Notation detail:* In C major, having two B naturals in a G7 chord was forbidden
- *Modern usage:* Octave doubling of melodic lines routinely doubles tendency tones
- *Why the rule existed:* Doubling creates parallel octaves when both resolve
- *Why it's broken:* In homophonic (chord-based) rather than polyphonic textures, the effect is reinforcement rather than voice-losing

---

## 4. STRUCTURAL RULE-BREAKING

### 4.1 Non-Resolution and Formal Ambiguity

**THE RULE:**
- Pieces should resolve to tonic at the end
- Dominant chords should resolve to tonic
- Form should create closure

**CHOPIN - Prelude in E Minor, Op. 28 No. 4**
- *What he broke:* Enharmonic spelling creates ambiguous resolution
- *Notation detail (m. 23):* Chord is spelled as dominant 4/2 (with Bâ™­ in bass), but Bâ™­ "resolves" upward to Bâ™® across a fermata silence
- *Harmonic analysis:* Spelled as Bâ™­, it's a Neapolitan 6/3; retrospectively functions as German augmented 6th (should be A#)
- *Why it works:* The silence embodies "negative action" - a gesture defined by intention NOT to carry out a premeditated resolution

**RADIOHEAD - Tonal Ambiguity as Style**
- *What they broke:* Songs that never establish clear tonic
- *Analysis term:* "Double-tonic complex" - two equally weighted keys
- *Example:* Am-F-C-G progression (Axis-a) creates ambiguity between A minor and C major; neither fully asserts itself
- *Why it works:* Conflates aspects of both modes; proportion of each mode varies throughout, creating floating, unresolved emotional state

---

## 5. THE TRITONE: FROM FORBIDDEN TO FOUNDATIONAL

### 5.1 Historical Context

**THE RULE:**
- Tritone (augmented 4th/diminished 5th) was called "diabolus in musica"
- Must be resolved: augmented 4th outward to major/minor 6th; diminished 5th inward to major/minor 3rd
- In counterpoint: avoid tritone even when reached stepwise unless continued stepwise in same direction

### 5.2 Modern Tritone Exploitation

**TONY IOMMI/BLACK SABBATH - "Black Sabbath" (1970)**
- *What he broke:* Built entire riff on unresolved tritone
- *Notation detail:* G-G (octave)-Dâ™­ (the tritone, augmented 4th above G)
- *Why it works:* The tension that begged for resolution in classical music becomes the identity of the genre; heavy metal embraces the "devil's interval" literally

**JAZZ TRITONE SUBSTITUTION**
- *The technique:* Replace V7 with â™­II7 (a tritone away)
- *Notation detail in C major:* Replace G7 with Dâ™­7 before resolving to C
- *Why it works:* Both G7 and Dâ™­7 share the same tritone (B-F or Câ™­-F); the substitution creates chromatic bass movement (D-Dâ™­-C) while maintaining harmonic function
- *Famous example:* Schubert's String Quintet in C major ends with Dâ™­7 instead of G7

## 6. SUMMARY: WHY RULE-BREAKING WORKS

### 6.1 Common Patterns

1. **Context Shift:** Rules designed for polyphonic vocal music don't apply to distorted guitars or impressionistic piano
2. **Intentional Signification:** "Wrong" notes work because they're meaningfully wrong (Monk)
3. **Historical Reclamation:** Parallel fifths evoke medieval music; polytonality evokes pre-tonal chaos
4. **Emotional Authenticity:** Ambiguity and non-resolution can better express complex emotional states than clean resolution
5. **Timbral Considerations:** Distortion, sustain, and electronic processing change which intervals work

### 6.2 The Meta-Rule

As Beethoven demonstrated: the rules exist for a reason, but the ultimate authority is your ear and your artistic intention. "Well, who has forbidden them?"
