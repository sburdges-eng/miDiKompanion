## The Electronic Sound

Key elements:
- **Powerful kick drums** — Foundation of the genre
- **Heavy bass** — Sub and mid presence
- **Builds and drops** — Energy management
- **Sound design** — Unique, crafted sounds
- **Effects and automation** — Constant movement

## The Kick Drum

### Why Kicks Matter Most

In electronic music, the kick IS the song's heartbeat.

**Characteristics of a good EDM kick:**
- Punchy attack (click)
- Controlled sub (not muddy)
- Consistent level
- Works with bass

### Kick Types

| Type | Character | Use For |
|------|-----------|---------|
| Punchy/House | Tight, mid-focused | House, pop-EDM |
| Subby/Techno | Deep, long tail | Techno, minimal |
| Short/Tight | Clicky, minimal sub | Drum & Bass, fast genres |
| Layered | Multiple kicks combined | Big room, festival |

### Layering Kicks

**Common approach:**
1. Sub layer (low sine, 40-60Hz)
2. Mid punch layer (body, 80-200Hz)
3. Click layer (attack, 2-5kHz)

**In Logic Pro:**
- Each layer on separate track
- EQ each to its range
- Phase-align the layers
- Adjust balance to taste

### Kick Processing

**EQ:**
- High-pass below 30Hz (remove sub-rumble)
- Cut mud (200-400Hz) if needed
- Boost click (3-5kHz) for presence

**Compression:**
- Often not much needed (samples pre-compressed)
- Light compression for consistency
- Parallel for power

## Bass and Sub

### Bass Types

| Type | Character | Use For |
|------|-----------|---------|
| Sub bass | Pure low (sine wave) | Under everything |
| Mid bass | Growl, presence | Main bass sound |
| Reese bass | Detuned, moving | DnB, dubstep |
| FM bass | Aggressive, metallic | Future bass, dubstep |

### The Sidechain Relationship

**Essential technique:**

Bass ducks when kick hits:
1. Insert compressor on bass
2. Sidechain input = kick
3. Fast attack, medium release
4. Creates pumping effect

**Settings:**
- Ratio: 4:1 to 10:1
- Attack: Fast (0-5ms)
- Release: Adjust to tempo (50-150ms)
- Threshold: Enough to duck noticeably

### Bass Mixing

**EQ:**
- High-pass around 30Hz
- Find fundamental (40-80Hz)
- Cut mud if needed
- Add presence (700-1000Hz) for smaller speakers

**Saturation:**
- Adds harmonics
- Bass audible on small speakers
- Don't overdo (distortion)

## Builds and Drops

### The Formula

**Build section (8-16 bars):**
1. Remove elements (strip down)
2. Add rising elements (risers, sweeps)
3. Increase intensity (drums, filter opening)
4. Create tension
5. Short silence before drop

**The Drop:**
1. Full energy (all elements)
2. Impact sound on downbeat
3. Main hook/melody
4. Strongest bass and drums
5. Maximum intensity

### Build Elements

**Risers:**
- White noise with rising filter
- Pitch-rising synth
- Reversed cymbal
- Get LOUDER toward drop

**Snare rolls:**
- Accelerating snare pattern
- Start slow, end fast (1/4→1/8→1/16→1/32)
- Velocity increases

**Filter sweeps:**
- Low-pass filter opening over time
- High-pass filter closing
- Automate cutoff

**Silence/Pause:**
- Brief moment before drop
- Creates anticipation
- Usually 1 beat to 1 bar

### Impact on the Drop

**What creates impact:**
- Crash cymbal
- All elements hit on 1
- Sub bass enters
- Impact/hit sample
- Maximum width

## Synth Sounds

### Lead Synths

**Supersaw lead:**
- 4-8 detuned saw waves
- Wide unison
- Classic trance/EDM sound

**Pluck lead:**
- Fast filter envelope
- Short decay
- Works for drops and melodies

### Pads

**Atmospheric pads:**
- Multiple oscillators
- Slow attack, long release
- Lots of reverb
- Movement (LFO on filter)

### Sound Design Tips

- Automate everything
- Layer sounds for thickness
- Use effects creatively
- Movement = life

## Arrangement

### Standard EDM Structure

```
Intro (16-32 bars)         — Establish elements
Build 1 (8-16 bars)        — Rising tension
Drop 1 (16-32 bars)        — Main energy
Breakdown (16-32 bars)     — Strip down, new element
Build 2 (8-16 bars)        — Rising tension again
Drop 2 (16-32 bars)        — Main energy (variation)
Outro (8-16 bars)          — Wind down
```

### Energy Map

```
Intro:     ██░░░░░░░░
Build 1:   ██████░░░░
Drop 1:    ██████████
Breakdown: ████░░░░░░
Build 2:   ██████████
Drop 2:    ██████████ (or higher)
Outro:     ████░░░░░░
```

### Section Contrast

| Element | Breakdown | Build | Drop |
|---------|-----------|-------|------|
| Kick | Out or minimal | Building | Full |
| Bass | Out or filtered | Filtered, rising | Full |
| Leads | Melodic, sparse | Building | Full |
| Pads | Present | Present | Can drop out |
| FX | Ambient | Risers, sweeps | Impacts |

## Effects and Automation

### Essential Automation

**Filter cutoff:**
- Automate for movement
- Open during builds
- Can close for variation

**Reverb sends:**
- More reverb in breakdowns
- Less in drops (tighter)

**Volume:**
- Subtle rides for emphasis
- Ducking for clarity

### Creative Effects

**Sidechain everything:**
- Not just bass
- Pads, leads, even reverbs
- Creates pumping feel

**Gating:**
- Rhythmic patterns
- Trance gates
- Creates movement

**Filtering:**
- High-pass builds (remove bass, then add back)
- Low-pass for darkness
- Automate for movement

## Mixing Electronic Music

### Kick and Bass Relationship

**Option 1: Sidechain**
- Bass ducks for kick
- Most common
- Clear and powerful

**Option 2: Frequency separation**
- Kick owns certain frequencies
- Bass owns others
- EQ to create space

### Making It Loud

**Gain staging:**
- Keep headroom during mixing
- Don't clip
- Peaks around -6dB on master

**Mix bus processing:**
- Light compression (glue)
- Saturation (warmth)
- EQ (tonal balance)

**Limiting:**
- Final stage
- Push into limiter for loudness
- Watch for distortion

### Width and Stereo

**Center:**
- Kick
- Sub bass
- Snare/clap
- Lead elements

**Wide:**
- Pads
- Effects (reverb, delay)
- High hats (can be)
- Background elements

**Technique:**
- Mid-side EQ
- Stereo widening on synths
- Keep low end mono
