## Recording Process

1. **Test Level**
   - Have vocalist sing loudest part
   - Adjust gain to peak around -12dB
   - Leave headroom for dynamics

2. **Record Multiple Takes**
   - Use Cycle Recording for automatic take folders
   - Or punch in/out for specific sections
   - Keep all takes — you'll comp later

3. **Take Notes**
   - Mark good takes with color/name
   - Note any issues (plosives, timing, pitch)

---

## Comping

1. Open Take Folder (click disclosure triangle)
2. Swipe across best sections
3. Flatten when satisfied
4. Keep take folder until mixing complete

## Common Issues & Fixes

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Plosives (P/B pops) | Move mic off-axis, use pop filter |
| Sibilance (harsh S) | Angle mic, fix with de-esser later |
| Room noise | Record at quieter time, use noise gate |
| Latency | Reduce buffer size, use direct monitoring |
| Thin sound | Move closer to mic (proximity effect) |
