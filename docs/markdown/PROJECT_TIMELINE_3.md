## 📝 Notes

### Development Principles

1. **Emotional First**: Every technical decision serves emotional expression
2. **User Empowerment**: Tools should make users braver, not replace them
3. **Graceful Degradation**: System should work even when components fail
4. **Test-Driven**: Write tests before features when possible
5. **Document Everything**: Code is read more than written

### Version Strategy

- **Major** (X.0.0): Breaking changes, major features
- **Minor** (0.X.0): New features, backward compatible
- **Patch** (0.0.X): Bug fixes, documentation updates

**Current Version**: 0.1.0-alpha (pre-release)
**Next Target**: 0.2.0-alpha (Q1 2026)
**First Stable**: 1.0.0 (Q2 2026)
