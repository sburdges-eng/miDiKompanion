# Jazz Production Guide

Capturing the feel, freedom, and sophistication of jazz.

## The Jazz Sound

Key elements:
- **Swing feel** — That bounce and groove
- **Improvisation** — Freedom within structure
- **Complex harmony** — Extended chords, substitutions
- **Conversational playing** — Musicians responding to each other
- **Dynamics** — Wide range from whisper to shout

---

## Jazz Rhythm and Feel

### Swing

**What is swing:**
The "long-short" feel on 8th notes. Not straight, not dotted — somewhere in between.

**Swing amounts by style:**

| Style | Swing | Feel |
|-------|-------|------|
| Straight-ahead | 60-66% | Classic jazz swing |
| Hard bop | 58-65% | Driving, energetic |
| Cool jazz | 55-60% | More relaxed |
| Fusion | 50-55% | Straighter, rock-influenced |
| Latin jazz | 50% | Straight 8ths typically |

### The Ride Cymbal

**The heartbeat of jazz drums:**
- Plays the swing pattern
- Constant but dynamic
- Accents on 2 and 4

**Classic ride pattern:**
```
1  +  2  +  3  +  4  +
x     X  x  x     X  x   (X = accent)
ding  DING-a ding  DING-a
```

### Comping Rhythm

**Piano/guitar "comping" (accompanying):**
- Rhythmically unpredictable
- Leaves space
- Responds to soloist
- Syncopated accents

---

## Jazz Harmony

### Extended Chords

**Jazz uses more than triads:**

| Chord Type | Formula | Sound |
|------------|---------|-------|
| Major 7 | 1-3-5-7 | Bright, sophisticated |
| Minor 7 | 1-b3-5-b7 | Warm, mellow |
| Dominant 7 | 1-3-5-b7 | Tension, wants to resolve |
| Minor 7b5 | 1-b3-b5-b7 | Dark, leading |
| Diminished 7 | 1-b3-b5-bb7 | Tense, passing |
| Major 9 | 1-3-5-7-9 | Open, colorful |
| Minor 9 | 1-b3-5-b7-9 | Rich, warm |
| Dominant 9 | 1-3-5-b7-9 | Full, bluesy |
| 13th chords | Add 13 | Very full, sophisticated |

### The ii-V-I Progression

**The most common jazz progression:**

In C major:
```
Dm7 - G7 - Cmaj7
(ii)  (V)   (I)
```

**Variations:**
- ii-V-I in major
- ii-V-i in minor (Dm7b5 - G7 - Cm7)
- Extended ii-V-I (add 9ths, 13ths)
- Tritone substitution (Dm7 - Db7 - Cmaj7)

### Voice Leading

**Smooth chord movement:**
- Notes move by small intervals
- Common tones stay put
- Guide tones (3rds and 7ths) resolve smoothly

---

## Jazz Instruments

### Drums

**Kit setup:**
- Ride cymbal (primary)
- Hi-hat (2 and 4 accent, feathering)
- Snare (comping, accents)
- Bass drum (feathered 4-on-floor or accents)
- Brushes common

**Programming jazz drums:**
- Very loose quantize (40-60%)
- Wide velocity range
- Ride cymbal drives the feel
- Hi-hat on 2 and 4
- Snare/kick comp around the beat

### Bass

**Walking bass:**
- Quarter notes moving through changes
- Outlines chord tones
- Passing tones connect chords
- Roots not always on beat 1

**Programming walking bass:**
- Each note different velocity
- Timing loose (±15-25ms)
- Longer notes, slight overlap
- Ghost notes occasionally

### Piano

**Voicings:**
- Left hand: roots and shells (1-7, 1-3)
- Right hand: extensions (9, 11, 13)
- Or: two-handed voicings
- Space between notes (not cluttered)

**Comping:**
- Rhythmically responsive
- Leave space for soloist
- Syncopated accents
- Velocity very dynamic

### Guitar

**Jazz guitar:**
- Clean tone or slight warmth
- Chord melody
- Single-note lines
- Comping behind soloists

### Horns (Sax, Trumpet, etc.)

**Phrasing:**
- Breath-based phrases
- Swing articulation
- Ghost notes and accents
- Blue notes (b3, b5, b7)

---

## Jazz Structure

### Standard Form

**32-bar AABA (most common):**
```
A (8 bars) - Main melody
A (8 bars) - Repeat
B (8 bars) - Bridge (new chords)
A (8 bars) - Return
```

**Then solos over the form.**

### 12-Bar Blues

**Jazz blues uses more chords:**
```
| I7    | IV7   | I7    | I7    |
| IV7   | IV7   | I7    | I7    |
| ii7   | V7    | I7    | V7    |
```

With many variations and substitutions.

### Head-Solos-Head

**Typical jazz arrangement:**
1. Play the melody ("head")
2. Solos over the chord changes
3. Play the melody again
4. Ending/tag

## Programming Jazz

### Quantization

**Jazz needs looseness:**
- Drums: 40-60% quantize
- Bass: 50-65% quantize
- Piano: 50-70% quantize
- Everything slightly behind (pull)

### Velocity

**Wide dynamics essential:**
- Piano: 30-120 range
- Drums: Huge variations
- Bass: Moderate variation (70-100)
- Nothing should be static

### Swing Application

- Apply swing to all instruments
- Different amounts can work (slight differences = more human)
- Test 58-66% range for straight-ahead

### Expression

**CC data for horns:**
- Expression (CC11) for dynamics
- Modulation (CC1) for vibrato
- Breath controller if available

## Jazz Sub-Genres

### Bebop

- Fast tempos
- Complex melodies
- Virtuosic improvisation

## Recording/Mixing Jazz

### The Sound

- Natural, acoustic

### Bass

**Upright bass:**
- Close mic + room

### Mixing Philosophy

- Less is more
- Preserve dynamics
