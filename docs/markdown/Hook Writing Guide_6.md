Creating the memorable moments that make songs stick.

## What Is a Hook

**The hook is the part that sticks in your head.**

It's what you hum, what you remember, what makes you want to hear the song again.

**Hooks can be:**
- A melodic phrase
- A lyrical line
- A rhythmic pattern
- An instrumental riff
- A sound or production element

**Most hit songs have multiple hooks working together.**

## Types of Hooks

### Lyrical Hook

**A phrase or line that sticks:**
- Usually contains the title
- Simple, memorable words
- Often repeated

**Examples:**
- "I can't get no satisfaction"
- "Hello, is it me you're looking for"
- "We will, we will rock you"

### Melodic Hook

**A tune that won't leave your head:**
- Simple, singable
- Distinct interval or shape
- Often in the chorus

**Think:** The melody you hum without words.

### Rhythmic Hook

**A rhythm that defines the song:**
- Syncopated pattern
- Distinctive groove
- Makes you move

**Examples:**
- "Billie Jean" bass line rhythm
- "We Will Rock You" stomp-stomp-clap
- Any song where you tap the rhythm first

### Instrumental Hook (Riff)

**A musical phrase that defines the song:**
- Guitar riff
- Synth line
- Bass groove
- Piano motif

**Examples:**
- "Smoke on the Water" riff
- "Sweet Child O' Mine" intro
- "Superstition" clavinet riff

### Sound Hook

**A unique production element:**
- A specific synth sound
- A vocal treatment
- An effect or texture

**Examples:**
- Auto-tune as creative choice
- A distinctive snare sound

## Hook Placement

### Where Hooks Go

**Most common:**
- First line of chorus
- Last line of chorus
- Throughout chorus (repeated)

**Other options:**
- Intro (instrumental hook)
- Pre-chorus (building hook)
- Post-chorus (additional hook)
- Throughout (riff-based songs)

### The Title Hook

**In most commercial songs, the title IS the hook.**

Place the title at:
- The most memorable melodic moment
- The emotional peak
- A repeated position

**If someone asks "what's that song?" they should answer with your hook/title.**

## What Makes Hooks Memorable

### Simplicity

**Simple beats complex every time:**
- Easy to sing
- Easy to remember
- Easy to repeat

**Test:** Can someone sing it back after one listen?

### Repetition

**Repetition creates familiarity:**
- Hook appears multiple times
- Key phrase repeats within the hook
- Pattern reinforces itself

**But:** Vary slightly to avoid boredom.

### Contrast

**Hooks stand out from the rest:**
- Different rhythm than verse
- Higher or catchier melody
- More energy/emotion
- Something that pops

### Emotional Connection

**Hooks that resonate stick:**
- Universal feelings
- Relatable ideas
- Emotional payoff

### Surprise

**Something unexpected:**
- Unusual interval
- Unexpected word
- Rhythmic surprise
- Twist on familiar pattern

## Hook Techniques

### Technique 1: Repetition with Variation

**Repeat a phrase with small changes:**
```
I want you (yeah)
I want you (ooh)
I want you (right now)
```

Each repetition adds something.

### Technique 2: Call and Response

**Question and answer pattern:**
```
Is this love? (This is love)
Is this love? (This is love)
```

Creates participation, sticks in head.

### Technique 3: The Contrast Hook

**Set up one thing, deliver another:**
- Quiet verse, loud hook
- Complex verse, simple hook
- Low melody, high hook moment

### Technique 4: Rhythmic Emphasis

**Strong rhythm makes hooks stick:**
- Syncopated accent
- Distinctive pattern
- Something you can clap

### Technique 5: Interval Hook

**A distinctive melodic jump:**
- Unexpected leap
- Memorable shape
- Signature of the song

**Example:** "Somewhere Over the Rainbow" — the octave leap on "some-WHERE"

### Technique 6: One-Word Hook

**Sometimes one word is enough:**
- "Hello" (Adele)
- "Royals"
- "Stay"

**Simple, clear, repeatable.**

### Technique 7: Chant Hook

**Group singalong quality:**
- "Hey Jude" — "na na na"
- "We Are the Champions"
- "Seven Nation Army" — "oh oh oh oh"

## Building a Hook

### Start with the Core

**What's the ONE thing you want to say?**
- Boil it down to essentials
- The simplest version of your message
- This becomes your hook

### Find the Melody

**Hum without words:**
- What tune naturally fits?
- What's singable?
- What stands out?

### Marry Words and Melody

**Best hooks:** Words and melody feel inevitable together.

**The stress should match:**
- Important words on strong beats
- Natural speech rhythm
- Melody serves the words (or vice versa)

### Test It

**Ask yourself:**
- Can I sing it from memory?
- Would someone else remember it?
- Does it make me feel something?
- Does it stand out from the verse?

## Multiple Hooks Strategy

### The Hit Song Approach

**Hit songs often have multiple hooks:**

| Hook Type | Location |
|-----------|----------|
| Instrumental hook | Intro, between sections |
| Verse melodic hook | A memorable moment in verse |
| Pre-chorus hook | Building phrase |
| Chorus lyrical hook | Main hook, title |
| Chorus melodic hook | The tune itself |
| Post-chorus hook | "The chant," additional repeat |

### Layering Hooks

**Example breakdown:**
```
Intro: Guitar riff (hook 1)
Verse: Memorable vocal phrase (hook 2)
Pre-chorus: Building "oh oh oh" (hook 3)
Chorus: Main lyrical hook (hook 4)
Chorus: Instrumental counter-melody (hook 5)
Post-chorus: Chant or repeat (hook 6)
```

**The song becomes impossible to forget.**

## Common Hook Mistakes

| Mistake | Problem | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Too complex | Hard to remember | Simplify |
| Not enough repetition | Doesn't stick | Repeat more |
| Buried in arrangement | Can't hear it | Feature it prominently |
| Wrong placement | Doesn't land | Put in memorable spot |
| No contrast | Doesn't stand out | Make it different from verses |
| Too many notes | Hard to sing | Reduce |
| Wrong syllable stress | Sounds awkward | Match natural speech |
| No emotional payoff | Doesn't connect | Find the feeling |

```
Original: "I'm feeling like I'm losing my mind"
Simplified: "Losing my mind"
Even simpler: "Losing it"
```

Which is most hookable?

### Exercise 4: Rhythm First
