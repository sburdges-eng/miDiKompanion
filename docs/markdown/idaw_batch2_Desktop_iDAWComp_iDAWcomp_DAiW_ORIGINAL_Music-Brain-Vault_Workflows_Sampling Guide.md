# Sampling Guide

Finding, chopping, and flipping samples into new music.

## What Is Sampling

Taking a piece of existing audio and using it in new music.

**Can be:**
- A drum break
- A chord progression
- A vocal phrase
- A single hit
- Ambient texture
- Any recorded sound

---

## Legal Basics

### The Reality

**Two copyrights exist:**
1. **Composition** (song) — melody and lyrics
2. **Sound Recording** (master) — the actual recording

**To legally release sampled music:**
- Clear both copyrights, OR
- Use royalty-free/cleared samples, OR
- Transform beyond recognition

### Clearing Samples

**Process:**
1. Find copyright holder (label for master, publisher for song)
2. Request permission
3. Negotiate terms (fee, royalty, credit)
4. Get it in writing

**Reality check:**
- Expensive (often thousands of dollars)
- Time-consuming
- Sometimes impossible (they say no)
- Major artists can afford it; indie artists often can't

### Legal Alternatives

**Royalty-free sample libraries:**
- Splice, Tracklib, LANDR Samples
- You pay for the sample, cleared for use
- Read terms carefully

**Creative Commons:**
- Free samples with attribution
- Check specific license terms

**Create your own:**
- Record your own source material
- Sample your own recordings
- No clearance needed

### Risk Levels

| Sample Type | Risk Level |
|-------------|------------|
| Recognizable hook from famous song | Very high |
| Obscure song, obvious sample | High |
| Heavily processed/disguised | Medium |
| Drum hit or single note | Low |
| Royalty-free/cleared | None |

**Disclaimer:** This is educational, not legal advice. Consult a lawyer for specific situations.

## Finding Samples

### Traditional Sources

**Vinyl crates:**
- Record stores
- Thrift shops
- Family collections
- Estate sales

**Genres to dig:**
- Soul, funk, R&B
- Jazz (especially 60s-70s)
- Disco
- World music
- Library music
- Obscure genres

### Modern Sources

**Streaming (for discovery):**
- Spotify playlists
- YouTube deep dives
- Shazam discoveries

**Then buy/rip:**
- Buy vinyl or CD
- Digital purchase
- Ensure you have the audio

**Sample services:**
- Tracklib (cleared samples)
- Splice (royalty-free)
- Noiiz, Sounds.com

### What to Look For

**Good sample candidates:**
- Interesting chord progressions
- Unique drum breaks
- Catchy melodies
- Unusual textures
- Open sections (fewer elements)
- Good recording quality

---

## Chopping Basics

### Import and Analyze

1. Import sample into DAW
2. Listen all the way through
3. Identify interesting sections
4. Mark potential chop points

### Finding the Tempo

**If clear beat:**
- Tap tempo feature
- Count bars, calculate BPM

**In Logic Pro:**
- Use Beat Mapping
- Or manually calculate

**Match to your project:**
- Time-stretch/compress
- Or build your track to sample's tempo

### Basic Chops

**Types of chops:**

| Type | What It Is |
|------|------------|
| Loop | Full phrase, repeated |
| One-shot | Single hit or stab |
| Slice | Individual pieces of a loop |
| Layer | Texture underneath other elements |

### Slicing Techniques

**Method 1: Manual chops**
1. Cut sample at transients or beats
2. Arrange on separate tracks or sampler
3. Rearrange order

**Method 2: Sampler auto-slice**
1. Load sample into sampler (EXS24, Quick Sampler)
2. Auto-slice by transient
3. Each slice maps to a key
4. Play new patterns

**Method 3: Flex Time**
1. Enable Flex (Logic)
2. Move individual beats
3. Create new rhythms

---

## Flipping Techniques

### Rearranging

**Change the order:**
- First half becomes second half
- Start from a different point
- Create new melody from pieces

**Example:**
Original: | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
Flipped:  | 3 | 1 | 4 | 2 |

### Tempo and Pitch

**Slow it down:**
- Darker, heavier vibe
- Lo-fi feel
- Pitch drops with tempo (or not, with time-stretch)

**Speed it up:**
- Brighter, more energetic
- Pitch rises with tempo (or not)

**Pitch shift:**
- Change key (up or down)
- Can hide original more
- Creates different mood

### Layering

**Combine sources:**
- Drums from Sample A
- Chords from Sample B
- Vocal from Sample C

### Filtering

**Low-pass filter:**
- Removes highs
- Warmer, muffled
- Classic technique

**High-pass filter:**
- Removes lows
- Thinner, texture-like
- Good for layering

**Automate filters:**
- Open and close for movement
- Create builds and transitions

---

## Processing Samples

### Basic Processing

**EQ:**
- Remove unwanted frequencies
- Make room for your elements
- Cut what clashes

**Compression:**
- Glue the sample together
- Add punch
- Control dynamics

**Saturation:**
- Add warmth
- Lo-fi character
- Glue to other elements

### Transformation

**Reverse:**
- Backwards samples
- Create swells and transitions
- Disguises original

**Time stretch (extreme):**
- Artifacts as texture
- Granular sounds
- Experimental approach

**Bit crushing:**
- Lo-fi digital texture
- SP-1200 style
- Grit and character

**Reverb:**
- Create space
- Blend into mix
- Atmospheric effect

### Hiding the Original

**If you need to disguise:**
- Pitch shift
- Chop very small (individual notes)
- Heavy processing
- Layer with original sounds
- Only use small portions

## Building a Track from Samples

### Workflow Example

**Step 1: Find your main sample**
- Chords or melody that inspires you

**Step 2: Set tempo**
- Match sample or choose new tempo
- Time-stretch or chop to fit

**Step 3: Chop and arrange**
- Create 4-8 bar loop
- Rearrange as needed

**Step 4: Add drums**
- Can be sampled drums too
- Or layer with programmed drums

**Step 5: Add bass**
- Often programmed/played
- Follows sample's harmony

**Step 6: Additional elements**
- More samples or original sounds
- Build arrangement

**Step 7: Process and mix**
- EQ to fit together
- Make it cohesive

## Sample-Based Drums

### Classic Breaks

**Famous breaks to study:**
- "Amen Brother" by The Winstons
- "Funky Drummer" by James Brown
- "Impeach the President" by The Honeydrippers
- "Apache" by Incredible Bongo Band
- "Think (About It)" by Lyn Collins

### Using Drum Breaks

**Option 1: Full loop**
- Loop the whole break
- Add your elements on top

**Option 2: Chop and replay**
- Slice each hit
- Program new patterns
- Mix elements from different breaks

**Option 3: Layer**
- Sample for feel
- Layer with punchy one-shots
- Best of both worlds

- Maps to keys
- Great for one-shots and slices

### EXS24 / Sampler

- More complex instrument creation
- Multiple samples across keyboard
- Velocity layers

- Move individual beats
- Quantize to grid

### Audio Reverse

- Right-click → Reverse
- Creates reverse audio

---

## Genre Applications

### Hip-Hop

- Soul and funk samples
- Chop and flip
- Drums from breaks
- Heavy processing often

### Electronic

- Found sounds
- Obscure sources
- Heavily transformed
- Textural use

### Pop

- Often vocal hooks
- Nostalgic reference

### Lo-Fi

- Jazz and soul
- Heavy filtering
