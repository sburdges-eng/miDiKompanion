## 💡 **TIPS FOR SUCCESS**

### **1. Start Small**
Don't try to use every feature immediately. Start with:
- Basic invoice creation
- Kitchen sheet generation
- Simple ingredient calculation

Then add:
- Production scheduling
- Advanced customizations
- Reporting and analytics

### **2. Be Patient**
The first 2-3 events will feel awkward as you learn the system. That's normal! By event 5-6, it will feel natural and save massive time.

### **3. Customize Gradually**
Don't try to answer all 35 Q&A questions on day one. Start with the essentials:
- Pricing (Questions 1-8)
- Basic menu options (Questions 9-14)
- Kitchen capacity (Questions 15-19)

Add more customizations as you identify needs.

### **4. Document Everything**
When you make changes or discover tips:
- Add notes to PROJECT_RULES.md
- Update WORKFLOW.md with your timing
- Create quick reference cards for staff
- Build your own knowledge base

### **5. Embrace Feedback**
After each event, ask your team:
- What worked well?
- What was confusing?
- What would make it easier?
- What should we change?

Then actually implement the good ideas!

### **6. Keep It Simple**
If a process feels too complicated, simplify it. The system should make your life easier, not harder. Don't be afraid to adapt.
