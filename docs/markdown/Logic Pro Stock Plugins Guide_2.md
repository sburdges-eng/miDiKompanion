## EQ Plugins

### Channel EQ

**Your go-to EQ for everything.**

**Strengths:**
- Clean, transparent

**Best for:**
- Most EQ tasks
- Surgical cuts
- Broad tonal shaping

**Tips:**
- Use the analyzer to see problems
- Option-click to solo a band (hear just that frequency)
- Double-click a band to reset it

### Linear Phase EQ

**For phase-sensitive situations.**

**Use when:**
- On the mix bus
- Mastering
- When phase matters

**Avoid when:**
- CPU is a concern
- Low latency needed

### Match EQ

**Copy EQ curves from reference tracks.**

**How to use:**
1. Load reference track
2. "Learn" the reference curve
3. Apply (scaled) to your track

**Tips:**
- Don't apply 100% — too extreme
- Use as a starting point
