# Folk & Acoustic Production Guide

Creating intimate, organic recordings with acoustic instruments.

---

## The Folk/Acoustic Sound

Key elements:
- **Natural, organic tone** — Real instruments, minimal processing
- **Intimacy** — Close, personal feel
- **Space and air** — Room to breathe
- **Dynamics** — Expressive, not compressed flat
- **Lyrics and story** — Often central focus

---

## Recording Acoustic Guitar

### Microphone Placement

**The sweet spot:** 12th fret area, 6-12 inches away

| Position | Sound |
|----------|-------|
| 12th fret | Balanced, full |
| Sound hole | Boomy (avoid direct) |
| Bridge | Bright, percussive |
| Neck joint | Warmer |
| Further back | More room, less direct |

### Stereo Recording

**X/Y Pair:**
- Two mics at 90-degree angle
- Pointed at 12th fret area
- Mono-compatible
- Natural width

**Spaced Pair:**
- One at 12th fret, one at bridge
- Wider stereo image
- Check phase

### The Room Matters

- Natural reverb adds character
- Dead room = add reverb later
- Live room = be careful of too much
- Small room reflections can work

### Processing Acoustic Guitar

**EQ:**
- HPF: 80-100Hz (remove rumble)
- Cut: 200-400Hz if muddy
- Add: 2-4kHz for presence
- Add: 8-12kHz for air (subtle)

**Compression:**
- Light (2:1 to 3:1)
- Medium attack (20-40ms)
- Keeps dynamics
- 2-4dB gain reduction max

## Recording Vocals for Folk

### The Intimate Sound

**Closer mic = more intimate:**
- 4-8 inches for intimate
- Use pop filter
- Proximity effect adds warmth
- Watch for plosives

### Room Sound

- Some room can be good
- Creates natural space
- Too much = muddy
- Experiment with distance

### Processing Folk Vocals

**Less is more:**
- Gentle compression (3:1)
- Subtle EQ
- Natural reverb (room or chamber)
- Don't over-process

**Keep the humanity:**
- Breaths (keep most of them)
- Pitch variation (don't over-tune)
- Dynamic expression

## Other Acoustic Instruments

### Mandolin

**Mic position:**
- Similar to acoustic guitar
- Bright instrument — may need less high-end
- 6-12 inches from sound hole/bridge area

### Banjo

**Mic position:**
- 6-12 inches from head
- Bright, percussive — tame highs if needed
- Watch for attack harshness

### Fiddle/Violin

**Mic position:**
- Above the instrument, angled down
- Or in front at distance
- Room sound often desirable
- Very dynamic — ride levels or compress gently

### Upright Bass

**Mic position:**
- In front of f-hole
- Or bridge area for more attack
- Often combined with DI
- HPF to remove rumble

### Piano

**Stereo pair:**
- Inside lid (hammers/strings)
- Or outside lid for more natural
- Low end = bass strings side
- High end = treble strings side

---

## Arrangement for Folk

### Less Is More

**Typical folk arrangement:**
- Vocal
- Acoustic guitar
- Maybe one other instrument
- Maybe harmony vocals
- That's it

### Building Dynamics Through Arrangement

| Section | Elements |
|---------|----------|
| Verse 1 | Voice + guitar only |
| Chorus 1 | Add light percussion or bass |
| Verse 2 | Similar to V1, slight variation |
| Chorus 2 | Add harmony vocal |
| Bridge | Strip back or change texture |
| Final Chorus | Full arrangement |

### Space and Silence

- Not every beat needs something
- Pauses are powerful
- Let phrases breathe
- Room between instruments

## Mixing Folk Music

### Philosophy

- Serve the song and lyrics
- Keep it natural
- Don't over-process
- Preserve dynamics
- Intimate, not huge

### Panning

**Typical setup:**
- Vocal: Center
- Acoustic guitar: Slightly off-center or stereo
- Bass: Center
- Other instruments: Spread naturally
- Not extremely wide usually

### Reverb

**Natural spaces:**
- Room or chamber reverb
- Short to medium decay
- Not too wet
- Creates cohesion

**Types that work:**
- Small room
- Chamber
- Plate (subtle)
- Hall (for bigger moments)

### Compression

**Keep dynamics:**
- Light compression overall
- 2:1 to 3:1 ratios typical
- Don't crush
- Manual volume rides often better

### EQ Approach

**Subtractive first:**
- Remove mud (200-400Hz)
- Remove harshness (2-4kHz if needed)
- HPF everything that doesn't need bass

**Additive carefully:**
- Air (10kHz+) if needed
- Presence (3-5kHz) subtle
- Don't over-brighten

## The Singer-Songwriter Setup

### Minimal Gear Needed

**Essentials:**
- One good condenser mic
- Interface
- Acoustic guitar
- Quiet room

**Nice to have:**
- Second mic for stereo guitar
- External preamp
- Acoustic treatment

### Recording Yourself

**Singing and playing together:**
- More natural performance
- Bleed between mics (can be okay)
- Or record separately for more control

**Separate recording:**
- More control in mix
- Can punch in fixes
- Less natural feel sometimes

## Sub-Genre Variations
