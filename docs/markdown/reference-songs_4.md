## COMMON CHORD PATTERNS IN THIS GENRE

| Pattern | Feel | Examples |
|---------|------|----------|
| I - V - vi - IV | The "axis progression" - hopeful/sad | Most pop-punk acoustic |
| i - VI - III - VII | Minor key sadness | Hotelier, heavier emo |
| I - vi - IV - V | Classic confessional | Julien Baker, Bright Eyes |
| vi - IV - I - V | Starting on minor - immediate weight | Sorority Noise |
| I - IV loop | Hypnotic, stuck, repetitive grief | Lua verses |

## YOUR PROGRESSION COMPARISON

**Your song (F - C - Am - Dm/Bb):**
- F = I
- C = V
- Am = iii
- Dm = vi
- Bb = IV

This is **I - V - iii - vi** for verses, **I - V - iii - IV** for weight moments.

The iii chord (Am) is what sets you apart from the standard axis. It's more melancholic, less resolved. Then Dm pulls you back to F. Bb adds the weight. This fits the genre perfectly.

## WHAT MAKES A SONG IN THIS GENRE WORK

1. **Specificity** — Not "I lost someone" but "I found the notes you left behind"
2. **Simple chords** — The complexity is in the words and delivery
3. **Earned dynamics** — Quiet builds to loud only when emotionally justified
4. **No hiding** — Production doesn't mask the rawness
5. **The pause** — Silence used as instrument
6. **Physical details** — The body, the room, the door, the floor
