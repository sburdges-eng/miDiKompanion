# Groove & Rhythm Feel Guide

Making your tracks feel good to move to — the science and art of groove.

---

## What Is Groove?

Groove is what makes music feel good to move to.

It's not just rhythm — it's:
- **Timing relationships** between instruments
- **Swing** and rhythmic feel
- **Where** beats land (early, late, on grid)
- **Accent patterns** that create forward motion
- **Space** between notes

You can't quantize your way to groove. You have to feel it.

## The Pocket

### What Is The Pocket?

When all instruments lock together with a feel that makes you want to move.

**It's about relationships:**
- Kick and bass working together
- Snare placement
- Hi-hat feel
- How everything aligns (or intentionally doesn't)

### Finding The Pocket

**Listen to:** The space between kick and snare. Does it feel:
- Driving (slightly ahead/tight)
- Laid back (slightly behind/loose)
- Right in the middle (straight, neutral)

**Adjust:** Nudge entire tracks or individual hits to find the feel.

---

## Push vs. Pull

### Pushing the Beat

**Playing ahead of the grid:**
- Creates urgency, excitement
- Driving feel
- Rock, punk, uptempo pop
- Makes things feel faster without changing BPM

**Which instruments push:**
- Hi-hats (common)
- Guitars (rock)
- Snare (driving feel)
- Lead vocals (eager, anxious emotion)

### Pulling the Beat

**Playing behind the grid:**
- Creates laid-back, relaxed feel
- Groovy, deep pocket
- Hip-hop, R&B, soul, reggae
- Makes things feel slower without changing BPM

**Which instruments pull:**
- Snare (classic hip-hop)
- Bass (groove feel)
- Vocals (cool, relaxed)
- Electric piano

### The Relationship That Matters

**Classic pocket groove:**
```
Kick:   ON the grid (anchor)
Snare:  15-30ms LATE (laid back)
Hi-hat: Slightly EARLY (driving)
Bass:   10-30ms LATE (with snare)
```

This creates tension and groove simultaneously.

## Swing

### What Is Swing?

Delaying every other note (the "ands") to create a bouncy, shuffled feel.

**Straight 8ths:**
```
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +
| | | | | | | |    (evenly spaced)
```

**Swung 8ths:**
```
1   + 2   + 3   + 4   +
|    |    |    |      |  ("ands" delayed)
```

### Swing Amounts

| Amount | Feel | Genre |
|--------|------|-------|
| 50% | Straight, no swing | Rock, pop, EDM |
| 52-54% | Very subtle shuffle | Light pop |
| 55-58% | Noticeable groove | Funk, R&B, hip-hop |
| 60-62% | Heavy swing | Deep hip-hop, soul |
| 66% | Triplet feel | Jazz, shuffle blues |

### Applying Swing in Logic Pro

**Region-based:**
1. Select MIDI region
2. Region Inspector → Quantize
3. Choose a swing preset
4. Or adjust Swing slider

**Track-based:**
- Groove templates (Drummer grooves, MPC grooves)
- Apply to entire track

### Different Swing Per Instrument

Not everything needs the same swing:
- Drums: More swing
- Bass: Matches drums
- Synths/Keys: Can be straighter
- Hats: Often swung differently than kick/snare

## Accent Patterns

### What Are Accents?

**Louder notes** that define the rhythmic feel.

### Basic Accent Patterns

**Downbeat accent (rock/pop):**
```
Beat:    1   +   2   +   3   +   4   +
Accent:  X       x       X       x
         (1 and 3 strongest)
```

**Backbeat accent (funk/R&B):**
```
Beat:    1   +   2   +   3   +   4   +
Accent:  x       X       x       X
         (2 and 4 strongest — the snare)
```

**Upbeat accent (reggae/ska):**
```
Beat:    1   +   2   +   3   +   4   +
Accent:      X       X       X       X
         ("ands" accented)
```

### Accent Through Velocity

Higher velocity = accented
Lower velocity = ghost/supporting

Create patterns by varying velocity, not just by adding/removing notes.

---

## Ghost Notes

### The Secret Sauce

Ghost notes are **very quiet notes** between the main beats.

They create:
- Forward motion
- Fills without filling
- Subtle complexity
- Human feel

### Ghost Note Rules

- Velocity: 25-45 (barely audible)
- Usually on 16th subdivisions
- Sparse — not on every beat
- Slightly loose timing

### Example Pattern

```
Beat:    1 e + a 2 e + a 3 e + a 4 e + a
Snare:       g   X g       g     X   g
Vel:        35  100 40    30    100 38
```

Main hits on 2 and 4, ghosts fill the space.

---

## Syncopation

### What Is Syncopation?

Accenting beats that are normally weak (the "ands" or 16th divisions).

**Creates:**
- Interest and surprise
- Forward momentum
- Rhythmic complexity

### Simple Syncopation

**Before (on the beat):**
```
1   +   2   +   3   +   4   +
X       X       X       X
```

**After (syncopated):**
```
1   +   2   +   3   +   4   +
X     X     X     X     X
    (notes shifted to "ands")
```

### Bass Syncopation

Move bass notes off the main beats:
```
Kick:  1   +   2   +   3   +   4   +
       X           X       X
Bass:      X   X       X       X   X
```

Creates interplay and groove.

## Groove Templates

### What They Are

Pre-made timing templates captured from real performances.

When you apply one, your MIDI conforms to that feel.

### How to Use in Logic Pro

1. Select MIDI region
2. Region Inspector → Quantize dropdown
3. Choose a groove (not just "1/8 Note")
4. Adjust Q-Strength

### Built-in Grooves

- **Drummer grooves:** From Logic's Drummer (human feel)
- **Classic Machines:** MPC, SP1200, Linn (sampler feel)
- **Vinyl grooves:** Sampled record feel

### Creating Your Own Groove

1. Find a loop or performance you love
2. Import or tap it in as MIDI
3. Select → Edit → Create Groove Template
4. Now you can apply it to anything

## Making Instruments Groove Together

### The Lock Points

**Kick and Bass:**
- Often hit together
- Or bass follows kick slightly (10-30ms)
- Should FEEL like one instrument

**Snare and everything else:**
- Snare is the reference for backbeat
- Other instruments relate to snare position

**Hi-hats:**
- Often the loosest element
- Create forward motion
- Can push or pull independently

### Checking the Groove

**Solo method:**
- Kick + bass alone: Do they lock?
- Kick + snare: Good foundation?
- Add hi-hats: Does it groove?
- Add everything else: Still grooving?

**If something feels off:**
- Nudge that element early or late
- Check velocity accents
- Check swing settings

## Quick Checklist

Before finalizing for groove:

- [ ] Kick and bass locked together
- [ ] Snare in the right pocket (pushed or pulled)
- [ ] Hi-hats have velocity variation
- [ ] Ghost notes on drums
- [ ] Not 100% quantized
- [ ] Swing applied where appropriate
- [ ] Accent pattern is clear
- [ ] Instruments relate to each other (not just grid)
