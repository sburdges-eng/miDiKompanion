## Platform Overview

### Where to Focus

**You don't need to be everywhere.** Pick 2-3 platforms and do them well.

| Platform | Best For | Content Type |
|----------|----------|--------------|
| TikTok | Discovery, virality | Short videos, trends |
| Instagram | Visual brand, Stories | Photos, Reels, Stories |
| YouTube | Long-form, music videos | Videos, Shorts |
| Twitter/X | Real-time, industry | Text, conversation |
| Facebook | Events, older demographic | Events, community |

### Where's Your Audience?

**Choose based on:**
- Where your fans actually are
- What content you enjoy making
- What format suits your personality
- Your genre (TikTok for pop, YouTube for rock, etc.)

## Content Strategy

### The Content Pillars

**Build around 3-5 pillars:**

1. **Music content** — Covers, originals, performances
2. **Behind-the-scenes** — Process, studio, life
3. **Personality** — Humor, opinions, relatable moments
4. **Educational** — Tips, gear, music knowledge
5. **Community** — Fan interactions, collaborations

### The Content Mix

**Rough guide:**
- 40% Value/entertainment (not promoting yourself)
- 30% Behind-the-scenes/personality
- 20% Music promotion
- 10% Direct asks (follow, stream, buy)

**The mistake:** All promotion, no value.

### Consistency Over Virality

**Reality:**
- Most posts won't go viral
- Consistency builds audience
- Show up regularly
- Quality over quantity (but quantity helps)

## Platform-Specific Tips

### TikTok

**What works:**
- 15-60 second videos
- Trending sounds (participate in trends)
- Music snippets over relatable content
- Personality and authenticity
- Behind-the-scenes moments
- Duets and stitches
- Hooks in first 1-3 seconds

**Posting frequency:** 1-3x per day ideally

**Tips:**
- Use trending sounds (even other people's music)
- Jump on trends quickly
- Be authentic, not polished
- Engage with comments
- Post consistently

### Instagram

**What works:**
- Reels (algorithm favors video)
- Stories (multiple per day)
- Carousels (for engagement)
- Photos (less reach but valuable)
- Lives (real-time connection)

**Posting frequency:** 
- Feed: 3-7x per week
- Stories: Daily
- Reels: 3-7x per week

**Tips:**
- Reels reach new people
- Stories maintain existing fans
- Use all features
- Hashtags still help (somewhat)
- Engage in your niche

### YouTube

**What works:**
- Music videos
- Covers
- Behind-the-scenes vlogs
- Tutorials
- Shorts (TikTok-style)

**Posting frequency:** Quality > quantity, but 1-4x per month

**Tips:**
- Thumbnails matter hugely
- First 30 seconds are critical
- Shorts feed the algorithm
- Long-form builds deeper fans
- SEO matters (titles, descriptions, tags)

### Twitter/X

**What works:**
- Thoughts and opinions
- Industry conversations
- Quick updates
- Text-based engagement
- Threads

**Posting frequency:** Multiple times daily if active

**Tips:**

## Building Engagement

### The Algorithm Truth

**Algorithms reward:**
- Watch time (people watching to end)
- Engagement (likes, comments, shares, saves)
- Consistency
- Platform-native content
- Use of new features

**They don't care about:**
- How good your music is
- How hard you worked
- Your follower count (much)

### How to Get Engagement

**Do:**
- Ask questions
- Create content worth sharing
- Respond to comments quickly
- End with CTAs (call to action)
- Make people feel something

**Don't:**
- Post and ghost
- Ignore comments
- Only post promotional content
- Be boring

### Calls to Action

**Soft CTA:** "What do you think?"
**Medium CTA:** "Follow for more"
**Hard CTA:** "Link in bio to stream"

**Mix them up.** Too many hard CTAs = ignored.

| Only posting music | No personality, hard to connect |
| Inconsistency | Algorithm punishes, fans forget |
| Ignoring comments | Kills engagement, seems arrogant |
| Too promotional | Annoying, people unfollow |
| Copying exactly | No originality, doesn't stand out |
| Comparing to others | Discouraging, different journeys |

## Measuring Success

### Metrics That Matter

| Metric | What It Means |
|--------|---------------|
| Engagement rate | How much people interact |
| Saves/Shares | Content worth keeping/spreading |
| Follower growth | Building audience |
| Click-throughs | Driving to music/website |
| Watch time | Content quality |

### Metrics That Matter Less

- Vanity likes (if no other engagement)
- Follower count alone
- Viral one-offs (if no retention)

### Reviewing Performance

**Weekly:**
- What performed well?
- What underperformed?
- What can you learn?
- What should you do more of?

## Sustainable Social Media

- Remember why you make music
- Social media is a tool, not the goal

### Setting Boundaries
