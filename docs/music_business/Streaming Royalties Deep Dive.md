# Streaming Royalties Deep Dive

Understanding how you get paid from streaming platforms.

## The Money Flow

When someone streams your song, multiple payments happen:

```
LISTENER streams song
        ↓
PLATFORM collects subscription/ad revenue
        ↓
┌───────────────────────┬─────────────────────┐
│   RECORDING ROYALTY   │  PUBLISHING ROYALTY │
│    (Master side)      │  (Composition side) │
│          ↓            │          ↓          │
│    Distributor        │    PRO + Publisher  │
│          ↓            │          ↓          │
│       Artist          │      Songwriter     │
└───────────────────────┴─────────────────────┘
```

## Two Types of Rights = Two Royalty Streams

### 1. Sound Recording (Master)

**What it is:** The actual recorded audio file

**Who owns it:** Whoever paid for the recording
- You (if self-released)
- Label (if signed)

**How you get paid:**
- Through your distributor (DistroKid, TuneCore, etc.)
- Per-stream payment

### 2. Musical Composition (Publishing)

**What it is:** The underlying song (melody, lyrics, harmony)

**Who owns it:** The songwriter(s)
- You (if you wrote it)
- Split with co-writers
- Publisher (if you have a deal)

**How you get paid:**
- Performance royalties → PRO (ASCAP, BMI, etc.)
- Mechanical royalties → MLC, distributor, or publisher

## Recording Royalties Explained

### How Streaming Pays

**The pool system:**
1. Platform takes its cut (~30%)
2. Remaining revenue goes into a pool
3. Pool divided by total streams
4. Your share = your streams ÷ total streams

**NOT per-stream fixed rate** — it's your share of the pool.

### Approximate Per-Stream Rates

| Platform | Range per Stream |
|----------|------------------|
| Spotify | $0.003 - $0.005 |
| Apple Music | $0.007 - $0.01 |
| Amazon Music | $0.004 - $0.005 |
| YouTube Music | $0.002 - $0.004 |
| Tidal | $0.008 - $0.013 |
| Deezer | $0.003 - $0.005 |
| Pandora | $0.001 - $0.003 |

*These fluctuate based on country, subscription tier, and overall platform streams.*

### What Affects Your Rate

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Country of listener | Developed countries pay more |
| Free vs. Premium | Premium pays more |
| Platform | Each pays differently |
| Time of year | Q4 often lower (more total streams) |
| Playlist type | Editorial vs. user affects it |

## Publishing Royalties Explained

### Performance Royalties

**What they are:** Payment for public performance of your composition

**Streaming counts as performance.**

**Collected by:** PROs (Performing Rights Organizations)
- ASCAP
- BMI  
- SESAC
- GMR
- International PROs in other countries

**You must register:**
1. Join a PRO (ASCAP or BMI for most US writers)
2. Register each song
3. They collect and pay you

### Mechanical Royalties

**What they are:** Payment for reproduction of your composition

**Every stream = a mechanical reproduction.**

**In the US, collected by:**
- The MLC (Mechanical Licensing Collective)
- Your distributor (some offer this)
- Your publisher (if you have one)

**You must register:**
1. Sign up at themlc.com
2. Register each song
3. They collect and pay you

### Publishing Admin

**If you don't have a publisher:**
- Use a publishing admin service

## The Registration Checklist

### To Collect ALL Your Money

**Recording side:**
- [ ] Signed with distributor
- [ ] Released to all platforms
- [ ] Metadata correct

**Publishing side (performance):**

## Payment Timelines

### The Delay

**Streaming → Payment takes time:**

| Step | Timeline |
|------|----------|
| Stream happens | Day 0 |
| Platform reports to distributor | 1-2 months |
| Distributor processes | 1-2 weeks |
| Payment to you | 2-3 months after stream |
| PRO payment | 6-9 months after stream |
| MLC payment | 3-6 months after stream |

**Total:** You might not see money for 3-9 months after streams.

### Payment Frequency

- **Distributors:** Monthly to quarterly
- **PROs:** Quarterly
- **MLC:** Monthly

## Understanding Your Statements

### Distributor Statements

- Country breakdown
- Stream counts
- Revenue per platform
- Your earnings after their fee (if any)

### PRO Statements

## Splits and Collaboration

### When You Co-Write

**Recording (Master):**
- Usually one person owns 100%
- OR splits negotiated

**Publishing (Composition):**
- Split among all writers
- Each writer registers their share with PRO
- Ensure all writers register correctly

### Example Split

**Song by you + one co-writer:**
- You: 50% publishing
- Co-writer: 50% publishing
- Master: You own 100% (you recorded/released it)

**Result:**
- You get 100% of recording royalties
- You get 50% of publishing royalties
- Co-writer gets 50% of publishing royalties

## Revenue Expectations

### Reality Check

|-----------------|-------------------------|
| 1,000 | $3-5 |
| 10,000 | $30-50 |

| 1,000,000 | $3,000-5,000 |
