# Sync Licensing Guide

Getting your music placed in TV, film, ads, and video games.

---

## What Is Sync Licensing?

**Sync (synchronization) licensing** = Permission to use music alongside visual media.

**Where sync placements happen:**
- TV shows
- Films
- Commercials/ads
- Video games
- Trailers
- YouTube videos
- Podcasts
- Social media content

**Why it matters:**
- Significant income potential ($100 to $500,000+ per placement)
- Exposure to new audiences
- Credibility/validation
- Passive income from re-airs

---

## The Two Rights

### Master Recording

**Who owns it:** Artist/label (whoever paid for recording)
**What it is:** The actual recorded audio file
**Fee:** Master use fee

### Composition (Publishing)

**Who owns it:** Songwriter/publisher
**What it is:** The underlying song (melody, lyrics, chords)
**Fee:** Sync fee

**Both rights must be cleared for sync placement.**

If you wrote AND recorded the song independently, you control both.

## Types of Placements

### Feature Placement

- Song is prominent/recognizable
- Character turns on radio, scene builds around song
- Usually higher fees ($5,000-$100,000+)

### Background Placement

- Song plays in background
- Not the focus of scene
- Lower fees ($1,000-$10,000)

### Theme/Title

- Main theme song
- Recurring use throughout series
- Highest fees + ongoing royalties

### Trailer

- Used in promotional material
- Short-term but high-impact
- Varies widely ($5,000-$500,000)

### Advertising

- Commercials, branded content
- Can be very lucrative
- National vs. local rates differ significantly

## What Music Supervisors Want

### Music Supervisors

**Who they are:** People who select music for productions

**What they're looking for:**
- Matches the mood/scene
- Fits the budget
- Clears quickly (no complicated rights)
- Professional quality
- Often instrumental versions available

### Sync-Friendly Music Traits

| Trait | Why It Matters |
|-------|----------------|
| **Clean masters** | Ready to use immediately |
| **Clear ownership** | No complicated splits |
| **Instrumental versions** | Often requested |
| **Vocal stems** | Flexibility for editors |
| **Specific moods** | Easy to categorize |
| **Not too "busy"** | Doesn't compete with dialogue |

## Getting Your Music Sync-Ready

### Technical Requirements

**Deliver:**
- Full mix (WAV, 24-bit/48kHz minimum)
- Instrumental version (critical)
- Vocal stem (useful)
- Clean version (no profanity if applicable)

**Label clearly:**
- Song title
- Artist name
- Version (full, instrumental, 30-sec edit, etc.)
- BPM and key

### Metadata

**Include:**
- All writers and publishers
- Contact information
- PRO affiliations (ASCAP, BMI, etc.)
- Ownership percentages
- Any samples or interpolations

### Splits and Ownership

**Keep it simple:**
- Fewer co-writers = easier clearance
- 100% ownership = fastest placement
- Complicated splits can kill deals

## Routes to Sync Placements

### Music Libraries

**What they are:** Companies that represent catalogs for sync

**Types:**
- **Exclusive:** They own/control your music
- **Non-exclusive:** You can license through multiple libraries
- **Retitling:** They rename your song (controversial)

**Major libraries:**
- Musicbed
- Artlist
- Epidemic Sound
- Audio Network
- Pond5
- Shutterstock Music

### Sync Agents

**What they are:** Pitch your music directly to music supervisors

**How they work:**
- You sign agreement (usually non-exclusive)
- They pitch to their contacts
- They take a percentage (10-30% typically)

**Finding agents:**
- Research sync agencies
- Apply/submit through their process
- Build relationships

### Direct Pitching

**Reaching music supervisors yourself:**
- Research who supervises shows you fit
- IMDB for credits
- LinkedIn for contacts
- Cold emails (professional, brief)
- Music conferences/events

### Publisher Placement

**If you have a publishing deal:**
- Publisher pitches your catalog
- They have relationships
- They take a cut (often 50%)

## Building a Sync-Worthy Catalog

### Create for Placement

**Intentional sync writing:**
- Study music in shows/films you like
- Note what moods are common
- Create music that fits needs

### Common Sync Moods

| Mood | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Uplifting/Inspiring | Triumph, achievement |
| Dark/Tense | Drama, thriller |
| Quirky/Fun | Comedy, light moments |
| Emotional/Sad | Tearjerkers, drama |
| Energetic/Driving | Action, sports |
| Romantic | Love scenes |
| Chill/Ambient | Establishing shots |

### Genre Demand

**Often needed:**
- Indie folk/acoustic
- Electronic (various)
- Orchestral/cinematic
- Hip-hop (instrumental)
- Pop (neutral lyrics)
- Ambient/atmospheric

**Think about:**
- Where could this song live visually?
- What scene does this fit?

## The Sync Process

### How a Placement Happens

1. **Supervisor searches** for music
2. **Your song discovered** (library, pitch, etc.)
3. **Supervisor requests** license quote
4. **Negotiation** on fees and terms
5. **Agreement signed** (both sides clear rights)
6. **Music used** in production
7. **Payment** (often net 30-90 days after air)
8. **Backend royalties** from PRO when aired

### Timeline

- Search to placement: Days to months
- Air date: Can be months after placement
- Payment: Weeks to months after air
- PRO royalties: 6-12 months after air
