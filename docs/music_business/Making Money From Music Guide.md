## Streaming Royalties

### How It Works

- You upload to streaming platforms (via distributor)
- Listeners stream your songs
- You get paid per stream (fractions of a cent)
- Paid monthly or quarterly

### The Numbers

| Platform | Rough Rate Per Stream |
|----------|----------------------|
| Spotify | $0.003 - $0.005 |
| Apple Music | $0.007 - $0.010 |
| Amazon Music | $0.004 - $0.006 |
| Tidal | $0.010 - $0.013 |

**10,000 streams ≈ $30-50** (varies by country, subscription type)

### Maximizing Streaming

- Release consistently
- Playlist placement (editorial + independent)
- Pre-save campaigns
- Focus on saves and playlist adds (affect algorithm)

### Realistic Expectations

- Unless you're viral, streaming is a slow build
- Supplement with other income
- Build catalog over time (compound growth)

---

## Sync Licensing

### What It Is

Your music placed in:
- TV shows
- Films
- Commercials
- Video games
- Trailers
- YouTube videos

### Why It's Valuable

- Upfront fee: $500 - $500,000+ (varies wildly)
- Backend royalties (when it airs)
- Exposure to new audiences
- Can be a significant income stream

### How to Get Sync

**DIY approach:**
- Submit to sync libraries
- Music supervisors (hard to reach directly)
- Networking at events

**Libraries and agencies:**
- Musicbed, Artlist, Epidemic Sound (non-exclusive)
- Sync agencies (take commission but have connections)
- Publishers with sync departments

**What they look for:**
- High-quality recordings
- Clean masters (no samples you don't own)
- Various moods and tempos
- Instrumental versions available

See [[Sync Licensing Guide]] for details.

## Live Performance

### Income Types

- Door splits (percentage of ticket sales)
- Guarantees (flat fee to play)
- Merch sales at shows
- Tips

### Building Toward Paying Gigs

**Free → Door Deal → Guarantee:**
1. Play for free (exposure, practice)
2. Door deals (you get % of tickets)
3. Small guarantees ($100-500)
4. Larger guarantees ($500-5,000+)
5. Tours with advances

### Maximizing Live Income

- Sell merch at EVERY show
- Collect emails at shows
- Book efficiently (route tours smart)
- Know your worth, but be realistic

## Merchandise

### What Sells

- T-shirts (always)
- Vinyl/CDs (for true fans)
- Hats, hoodies
- Unique items related to your brand
- Limited editions

### Getting Started

**Print-on-demand:**
- Printful, Printify
- No inventory
- Lower margins but lower risk
- Good for starting out

**Bulk ordering:**
- Higher margins
- Need storage
- Risk of unsold inventory
- Better once you have demand

### Pricing

- Don't undervalue (fans want to support)
- Know your margins
- Bundles work well (album + shirt)

---

## Publishing Royalties

### What It Is

Money earned from your SONGS (not recordings):
- Radio play
- Live performances of your songs
- Streaming
- Covers
- Sheet music

### The Two Copyrights

1. **Composition (song):** Melody + lyrics (publishing)
2. **Sound recording (master):** The actual recording

**You own both** unless you've signed them away.

### Collecting Publishing

**PRO (Performance Rights Organization):**
- ASCAP, BMI, SESAC, SOCAN (by country)
- Collects performance royalties
- Register your songs
- FREE to join (mostly)

**Mechanical royalties:**
- Streaming, downloads
- Harry Fox Agency, MLC (US)
- Distributed through distributors too

**Make sure you're registered** — money goes uncollected.

- Pursue sync
- More shows

**Year 5+:**

## Protecting Your Income

### Own Your Masters

- Understand what you're signing

### Register Everything

- PRO registration (songs)
- Copyright registration (optional but protective)
- Make sure royalties come to YOU

### Contracts

- Get a lawyer for any significant deal

- Nothing is standard — negotiate

## Realistic Expectations

### What It Takes

- Years to build (usually 5-10+)
- Consistent output
- Multiple income streams
- Treating it like a business
- Financial ups and downs

### Numbers That Work

**$50K/year example:**
- 2M streams = ~$6,000
- 50 shows at $300 average = $15,000
- 500 merch items at $30 = $15,000
- Teaching: $500/month = $6,000
- Sync: 2 placements = $4,000
- Patreon: 100 patrons at $5 = $6,000

**Adds up.** But takes time to build each stream.
