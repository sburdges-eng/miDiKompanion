# Rule-Breaking Practical Guide

> "The wrong note played with conviction is the right note."

This guide bridges music theory and emotional intent. It's not about what's "correct" — it's about what *works*.

## Core Philosophy

1. **Theory explains what works. It doesn't create what works.**
2. **Rules exist so you know what you're breaking.**
3. **The best chord is the one that makes the lyric hit harder.**

## Borrowed Chords Quick Reference (Key of F Major)

| Chord | Roman | Notes | Borrowed From | Emotional Effect |
|-------|-------|-------|---------------|------------------|
| Bbm | iv | Bb-Db-F | F minor | Instant melancholy |
| Db | bVI | Db-F-Ab | F minor | Epic, cinematic |
| Eb | bVII | Eb-G-Bb | F mixolydian | Rock swagger |
| Ab | bIII | Ab-C-Eb | F minor | Unexpected brightness |

### When to Use Each

**iv (minor four):** The lyric turns sad. The memory darkens. Something breaks.

**bVI (flat six):** "Here comes the emotional part." Pre-chorus lifts. Cinematic moments.

**bVII (flat seven):** Defiance. Rock endings. Refusing to resolve "properly."

**bIII (flat three):** Twist. The unexpected. Modal shift without leaving home.

## Substitution Patterns

### The Sad IV
```
Original:  F - C - Bb - F
RuleBreak: F - C - Bbm - F
```
**Voice Leading:** Bb stays, D→Db (chromatic), F stays
**Famous Use:** Radiohead "Creep" (the Cm chord)

### The Epic Detour
```
Original:  F - C - Am - Dm
RuleBreak: F - C - Db - F
```
**What Changed:** iii-vi → bVI-I
**Famous Use:** Every 80s power ballad

### Mixolydian Swagger
```
Original:  F - C - G - F
RuleBreak: F - C - Eb - F
```
**What Changed:** II → bVII
**Famous Use:** Beatles "Norwegian Wood"

## Emotion → Chord Mapping

### Grief
- **Use:** iv, bVI, Imaj7
- **Avoid:** V7 resolving cleanly
- **Production:** Space, breath, imperfection
- **Example:** `I - iv - bVI - I`

### Nostalgia
- **Use:** maj7, add9, sus4
- **Avoid:** Hard resolutions
- **Production:** Lo-fi warmth, reverb = distance
- **Example:** `Imaj7 - vi7 - IVmaj7 - V7sus4`

### Anger
- **Use:** power chords, bVII, minor
- **Avoid:** Sweet resolutions
- **Production:** Distortion, hard compression
- **Example:** `i - bVII - iv - i`

### Dissociation
- **Use:** maj7, bVII, sus chords
- **Avoid:** Strong roots
- **Production:** Buried vocals, blur
- **Example:** `Imaj7 - bVII - IV - I`

## Production Rules to Break

| Rule | When to Break | Example |
|------|---------------|---------|
| Cut mud at 200-400Hz | Song about feeling trapped | Billie Eilish |
| Vocals clear and upfront | Intimacy, dissociation | My Bloody Valentine |
| Fix pitch problems | Emotional honesty | Elliott Smith |
| Remove room noise | Authenticity | Bon Iver "For Emma" |
| Quantize timing | Human feel needed | J Dilla, D'Angelo |

### The Meta-Rule
**If it sounds good, it IS good.**
But "good" means "serves the song" — not "technically correct."

## Rhythmic Misdirection

### Ghost Notes
- Very quiet notes between main beats
- Creates "breathing" feel
- Essential for: Funk, R&B, Hip-hop

### Laid Back Snare
- Snare hits slightly behind the beat
- Creates swagger, deep pocket
- Essential for: Hip-hop, Neo-soul, Blues

### Push the 1
- Start phrase slightly before downbeat
- Creates urgency
- Essential for: Rock, Punk

### Exercise
Take a quantized MIDI drum pattern:
1. Move the snare 10-20ms late
2. Move the hi-hats slightly early
3. Listen to how the feel transforms

## The Kelly Song Application

For F-C-Am-Dm at 82 BPM:

**Verse:** Keep standard, establish comfort
**Pre-Chorus:** Introduce Bbm (iv) — the first shadow
**Chorus:** F-C-Db-F (bVI resolution) — the emotional arrival
**Final Reveal:** End on Dm unresolved — grief doesn't resolve

**Production Notes:**
- Lo-fi bedroom aesthetic
- Let pitch drift on emotional peaks
- Room sound = intimacy
- Don't fix the cracks in the voice — they're the point

## Dataview Integration

```dataview
TABLE emotion, chords, production
FROM "vault"
WHERE contains(tags, "songwriting") AND contains(tags, "harmony")
SORT updated DESC
```

*The audience doesn't hear "borrowed from Dorian." They hear "that part made me cry."*
