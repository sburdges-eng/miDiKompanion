# Rewriting and Editing Guide

How to revise, polish, and strengthen your songs.

---

## Why Rewriting Matters

**The truth:** First drafts are rarely final drafts.

Great songs are often:
- Written quickly
- Then rewritten extensively

**Hemingway:** "The first draft of anything is garbage."

**Applied to songs:** Your initial inspiration is gold — then you refine it.

## When to Rewrite

### Not During Creation

**Create first, edit later.**

When writing:
- Don't stop to fix
- Don't judge too early
- Keep momentum
- Get it all out

When editing:
- Step back objectively
- Evaluate what's working
- Fix what isn't

### The Gap

**Wait before rewriting:**
- Hours (at minimum)
- A day (better)
- A week (ideal for perspective)

Fresh ears hear problems you missed.

## What to Evaluate

### The Big Picture

**Before line-by-line:**
- Does the song work as a whole?
- Is there a clear story/emotion?
- Does the structure serve the song?
- Is there a memorable hook?

### Section by Section

**Ask of each section:**
- Does it serve its purpose?
- Is it the right length?
- Does it flow from what came before?
- Does it lead naturally to what's next?

### Line by Line

**After structure is solid:**
- Is every word necessary?
- Is every word the RIGHT word?
- Does each line earn its place?

## Common Problems and Fixes

### Weak Opening

**Problem:** Song takes too long to grab attention.

**Fixes:**
- Start with the hook earlier
- Cut the first verse (often unnecessary)
- Begin in the action (not setup)
- Open with strongest line

### Vague Lyrics

**Problem:** Too abstract, doesn't connect.

**Fixes:**
- Add specific details
- Show, don't tell
- Use concrete images
- Replace clichés with fresh language

**Before:** "I feel so sad without you"
**After:** "Your coffee cup's still in the sink"

### Boring Melody

**Problem:** Melody is predictable or forgettable.

**Fixes:**
- Add unexpected notes
- Change the rhythm
- Use bigger intervals (jumps)
- Contrast high/low
- Syncopate

### Wrong Chords

**Problem:** Chords don't support the emotion.

**Fixes:**
- Try different progressions
- Add/remove extensions (7ths, sus)
- Change from major to minor (or vice versa)
- Simplify or complicate

### No Payoff

**Problem:** Chorus doesn't lift, song feels flat.

**Fixes:**
- Make chorus melody go HIGHER
- Add more energy (instrumentation, rhythm)
- Strengthen the hook
- Create more contrast with verse

### Too Long

**Problem:** Song drags, loses interest.

**Fixes:**
- Cut a verse
- Shorten sections
- Remove unnecessary words
- Get to chorus faster

### Too Repetitive

**Problem:** Gets boring, nothing changes.

**Fixes:**
- Add a bridge
- Vary verse melodies slightly
- Change lyrics in final chorus
- Build arrangement through song

### Forced Rhymes

**Problem:** Rhymes sound unnatural or awkward.

**Fixes:**
- Change the line for a better rhyme
- Use near-rhymes (moon/home, love/enough)
- Don't rhyme that line
- Reorder words

## Editing Techniques

### The Cut Test

**Remove and listen:**
1. Take out a section (or line)
2. Play without it
3. Does the song miss it?
4. If not, cut it

### The Stranger Test

**Imagine a stranger hears this:**
- Will they understand it?
- Will they feel something?
- Will they remember it?
- Would they listen again?

### The Sing Test

**Sing it out loud:**
- Does it feel natural to sing?
- Are the words singable?
- Do stressed syllables align with beats?
- Can you breathe?

### The Phone Test

**Record on your phone and listen:**
- In the car
- On a walk
- In a different room
- Problems become obvious

### The Time Test

**Put it away, come back later:**
- Fresh ears
- New perspective
- Emotional distance
- Problems pop out

## Getting Feedback

### Who to Ask

**Good feedback sources:**
- Other songwriters
- Trusted musicians
- Honest friends (who know music)
- Your gut (after time away)

**Be careful with:**
- People who only praise
- People who only criticize
- Non-musicians (unless for emotional response)

### How to Ask

**Be specific:**
- "Does the second verse feel too long?"
- "Is the hook memorable?"
- "What emotion does this give you?"

**Not:**
- "What do you think?" (too vague)

### How to Receive

**Listen without defending:**
- Take notes
- Don't argue
- Ask clarifying questions
- Thank them

**Then decide:**
- Which feedback resonates?
- What rings true?
- What doesn't fit your vision?

## When to Stop

### Signs You're Done

- Every word earns its place
- The song says what you meant
- You've addressed known problems
- Fresh listeners respond well
- You're tweaking for the sake of tweaking

### The Danger of Over-Editing

**Symptoms:**
- You've lost the original spark
- It feels like a different song
- You're going in circles
- Nothing ever feels finished

**Treatment:**
- Go back to an earlier version
- Accept "good enough"
- Set a deadline
- Move to production (new perspective)

## Rewriting Workflow

### Step 1: Rest

Wait before editing (hours to days).

### Step 2: Listen Fresh

Play the demo without looking at lyrics.
Note what works and what bugs you.

### Step 3: Big Picture

- Structure working?
- Story clear?
- Hook strong?

Fix big issues first.

### Step 4: Section by Section

- Does each section work?
- Right length?
- Flow naturally?

### Step 5: Line by Line

- Every word right?
- Every melody note right?
- Polish the details.

### Step 6: Feedback

Get outside ears.
Incorporate useful notes.

### Step 7: Final Pass

One more listen.
Fix any last issues.
Call it done.
