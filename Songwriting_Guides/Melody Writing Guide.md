# Melody Writing Guide

Creating memorable, singable melodies that stick in people's heads.

---

## What Makes a Great Melody

**Memorable melodies have:**
- **Singability** — Easy to sing or hum
- **Shape** — Clear contour (rises and falls)
- **Repetition** — Patterns that repeat with variation
- **Surprise** — Unexpected moments within familiarity
- **Rhythm** — Interesting rhythmic patterns

**The test:** Can you remember it after one listen?

## Melodic Contour (Shape)

### Why Shape Matters

Melodies have visual shapes when you map them:

```
     *           
    * *    *     ← Rising and falling
   *   *  * *    
  *     **   *   
```

**Different shapes create different feelings:**

| Shape | Feeling | Use For |
|-------|---------|---------|
| Rising | Building, hopeful, energetic | Pre-chorus, builds |
| Falling | Resolving, sad, calming | Endings, verses |
| Arch (rise then fall) | Complete, satisfying | Chorus, phrases |
| Wave (up-down-up-down) | Dynamic, interesting | Throughout |
| Flat/Static | Tension, intensity, hypnotic | Rap, spoken, chant |

### Creating Good Contour

**Rules of thumb:**
- High notes = emotional peaks (use sparingly)
- Low notes = grounding, resolution
- Range should match the emotion
- Don't stay in one place too long

## Repetition and Variation

### The Balance

**Too much repetition = boring**
**Too little repetition = forgettable**

**The sweet spot:** Repeat with small changes.

### Repetition Techniques

**Exact repetition:**
```
Phrase A → Phrase A
(Same melody, same words)
```

**Sequence (same shape, different pitch):**
```
Phrase A → Phrase A (higher/lower)
C-D-E → D-E-F → E-F-G
```

**Variation (similar but different):**
```
Phrase A → Phrase A' (slight change at end)
```

**Question and Answer:**
```
Phrase A (feels incomplete) → Phrase B (resolves)
```

### The 4-Bar Phrase

**Most common structure:**
```
Bar 1-2: Melodic idea
Bar 3-4: Response or variation
```

**Example pattern:**
```
Bars 1-2: Phrase A
Bars 3-4: Phrase A' (variation)
Bars 5-6: Phrase B (contrast)
Bars 7-8: Phrase A or C (resolve)
```

## Rhythm in Melody

### Rhythmic Interest

**Melody isn't just pitch — it's rhythm.**

**Rhythmic techniques:**
- **Syncopation** — Notes on unexpected beats
- **Long + short** — Mix held notes with quick notes
- **Rests** — Silence is powerful
- **Pickup notes** — Start before the bar line

### Syllable Rhythm

**Match words to natural speech rhythm:**
- Stressed syllables on strong beats
- Unstressed syllables on weak beats
- "a-ROUND" not "A-round"

### Rhythmic Hooks

**Memorable rhythms stick:**
- "We Will Rock You" — stomp-stomp-clap
- "Billie Jean" — rhythmic groove defines the song
- Simple patterns that lock in your head

---

## Range and Tessitura

### Singable Range

**Most people can comfortably sing:**
- About 1 octave (for casual singers)
- 1.5 octaves (for trained singers)

**Keep verses in comfortable range, save high notes for chorus/climax.**

### Tessitura (Where It Sits)

**Where most of the melody lives:**
- Too high = strain, fatigue
- Too low = mumbling, no energy
- Sweet spot = comfortable with room to go up

### Strategic High Notes

**High notes = emotional peaks:**
- Use sparingly (1-2 per song)
- Place at important lyrical moments
- Don't start high (nowhere to go)

## Melodic Intervals

### What Are Intervals

The distance between two notes.

| Interval | Sound | Feeling |
|----------|-------|---------|
| Step (2nd) | Smooth, connected | Natural, flowing |
| 3rd | Pleasant, easy | Comfortable, melodic |
| 4th | Open, strong | Anthem, bold |
| 5th | Wide, powerful | Heroic, strong |
| 6th | Emotional, sweeping | Romantic, expressive |
| 7th | Tense, reaching | Yearning, dramatic |
| Octave | Wide, open | Dramatic, powerful |

### Using Intervals

**Mostly steps and 3rds:**
- Makes melody singable
- Sounds natural

**Occasional leaps (4th+):**
- Creates interest
- Marks important moments
- Use strategically

**Big leaps (6th+):**
- Very emotional
- Use for climactic moments
- Follow with stepwise motion

### The Leap Rule

**After a large leap, change direction:**
```
Big jump UP → step back DOWN
Big jump DOWN → step back UP
```

## Scales and Modes

### Major vs. Minor

| Mode | Feeling | Use For |
|------|---------|---------|
| Major | Happy, bright, uplifting | Feel-good songs |
| Minor | Sad, dark, emotional | Emotional songs |

### Pentatonic Scale

**The "can't go wrong" scale:**
- Major pentatonic: C-D-E-G-A (happy)
- Minor pentatonic: A-C-D-E-G (bluesy)

**Most pop melodies live in pentatonic territory.**

### Using Scales

**Don't use every note:**
- Stick to a few key notes
- Emphasize chord tones (1, 3, 5)
- Pass through other notes
- Chromatic notes for color (use sparingly)

## Melody Writing Techniques

### Start With Rhythm

1. Speak the lyrics rhythmically
2. Find a natural rhythm pattern
3. Add pitches to the rhythm

### Improvise Over Chords

1. Play your chord progression
2. Record yourself singing nonsense
3. Find the melodies hiding in your improvisation

### Humming Method

1. Hum without thinking
2. Record everything
3. Find the gems in the rambling

### Constraint Method

1. Set limitations:
   - Only use 3 notes
   - Only use steps (no leaps)
   - Only use this rhythm
2. Write within constraints
3. Constraints = creativity

### Melodic Fragments

1. Write short 2-4 note fragments
2. Mix and match fragments
3. Build melody from pieces

## Melody vs. Section

### Verse Melody

**Characteristics:**
- More conversational
- Lower energy than chorus
- Sets up the story
- More rhythmic flexibility
- Can be more complex

### Chorus Melody

**Characteristics:**
- More memorable/singable
- Higher energy
- Contains the hook
- More repetitive
- Often higher range

### Pre-Chorus Melody

**Characteristics:**
- Builds toward chorus
- Rising contour often
- Creates anticipation
- Transitional

### Bridge Melody

**Characteristics:**
- Different from verse/chorus
- New melodic territory
- Can be highest point
- Creates contrast

## Hooks and Earworms

### What Makes a Hook

**The part that sticks:**
- Simple enough to remember
- Unique enough to stand out
- Often uses title
- Rhythmically distinctive

### Hook Placement

**Usually in chorus:**
- First line of chorus
- Last line of chorus
- Or both (repeated)

### Hook Techniques

- **Repetition:** Repeat the hook phrase
- **Title use:** Hook = song title
- **Rhythm:** Distinctive rhythmic pattern
- **Interval:** Memorable melodic interval
- **Simplicity:** Easy to sing back

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Problem | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Too many notes | Hard to remember | Simplify, use space |
| Too narrow range | Boring, flat | Add strategic leaps |
| Too wide range | Hard to sing | Keep comfortable |
| No shape | Aimless | Plan contour with peaks |
| No repetition | Forgettable | Repeat key phrases |
| Too much repetition | Boring | Add variation |
| Wrong syllable stress | Sounds unnatural | Match speech rhythm |

## Exercise: Write a Melody
