# Toplining Guide

Writing melodies and lyrics over existing tracks/beats.

## What Is Toplining?

**Toplining** = Writing the vocal melody and lyrics over a pre-made instrumental track.

**Common in:**
- Pop music
- EDM and dance
- Hip-hop (melodic hooks)
- Commercial songwriting
- Sync/library music

**The track producer makes the music. You write the top.**

---

## The Topliner's Role

### What You Provide

- Vocal melody
- Lyrics
- Song structure (where verses/choruses go)
- Hook/catchiness
- Emotional content

### What You Work With

- Pre-made beat or track
- Sometimes nearly finished production
- Sometimes just chords and drums
- Mood and vibe already established

---

## The Toplining Process

### Step 1: Listen First

**Before singing anything:**
- Listen to the track 3-5 times
- Feel the energy and mood
- Notice the structure (if any)
- Identify the "money moments" (drops, builds)
- Let it sink in

**Ask yourself:**
- What emotion does this evoke?
- What's the energy level?
- Where are the natural verse/chorus spots?
- What's the vibe? (party, sad, introspective, etc.)

### Step 2: Find the Pockets

**Where does the vocal sit?**
- Listen for space in the arrangement
- Find where vocals won't fight other elements
- Notice rhythmic pockets

**Mark the sections:**
- Where should verse be?
- Where should chorus hit?
- Is there a pre-chorus moment?
- Where's the bridge?

### Step 3: Mumble Pass

**Don't write lyrics yet:**
1. Play the track
2. Mumble, hum, sing nonsense
3. Find what naturally fits
4. Record everything
5. Let melody come before words

**The goal:** Find the natural melody shape.

### Step 4: Capture the Hook

**Find the chorus first:**
- The most important part
- Should be the most memorable
- Often where the track is biggest
- Spend the most time here

**Record multiple options:**
- Try 3-5 different hook ideas
- Don't commit too early
- The best one will stand out

### Step 5: Write the Lyrics

**Now add words:**
- Fit words to the melody shape
- Don't force syllables
- Keep it natural
- Start with the hook/title

### Step 6: Complete the Song

- Verse lyrics
- Pre-chorus if needed
- Bridge
- Any variations
- Full demo vocal

## Melody Techniques for Toplining

### Rhythmic Matching

**Lock into the track's rhythm:**
- Follow the groove
- Accent where the track accents
- Don't fight the beat

### Space and Phrasing

**Leave room:**
- Not every beat needs vocals
- Space makes hooks memorable
- Let the track breathe

### Range Considerations

**For pitchable songs:**
- Keep range reasonable (octave + a few notes)
- Consider who might sing it
- Demo in a singable key
- Note if key change needed for artist

### Hook Placement

**Where hooks hit hardest:**
- First line of chorus
- Repeated phrase
- Post-chorus earworm
- Sometimes in the intro

## Lyric Techniques for Toplining

### Universal but Specific

**For commercial toplining:**
- Themes many people relate to
- But specific details make it real
- Love, heartbreak, partying, empowerment
- Avoid too niche or personal

### Title Visibility

**Make the title clear:**
- Title should appear in chorus
- Usually the most repeated phrase
- Ideally memorable and searchable

### Conversational Flow

**Natural language:**
- Sing how you'd talk
- Don't invert sentences awkwardly
- Modern pop is conversational

### Syllable Awareness

**Match syllables to melody:**
- Stressed syllables on strong beats
- Don't cram too many words
- Simplicity often wins

---

## Working with Track Producers

### Communication

**Before the session:**
- Discuss vibe and direction
- Any reference tracks?
- Who's the target audience?
- Any must-haves?

**After the session:**
- Send options clearly labeled
- Note what's working, what's uncertain
- Be open to feedback and revisions

### Revisions

**Expect revisions:**
- First pass rarely final
- Producer may have input
- Labels/A&R may have notes
- Be flexible, not precious

### Splits

**Common arrangements:**
- Producer gets production/track percentage
- Topliner gets melody/lyrics percentage
- Typical: 50/50 or varies

**Discuss upfront.**

## Delivering Toplines

### What to Send

**Standard deliverables:**
1. **Demo vocal** (full song, rough mix is fine)
2. **Vocal stem** (dry vocal, no effects)
3. **Lyrics document** (with structure labeled)
4. **Session file** (if requested)

### File Naming

Clear, professional naming:
```
SongTitle_Topline_ArtistName_Date.wav
SongTitle_Vocals_Dry.wav
SongTitle_Lyrics.docx
```

### Quality Standards

- Clean recordings (minimal room noise)
- Tuned if necessary (but don't over-tune demos)
