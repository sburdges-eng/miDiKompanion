Crafting words that connect, move, and stick with listeners.

## What Makes Great Lyrics

**Great lyrics:**
- **Say something** — Have meaning and intention
- **Show, don't tell** — Use imagery over statements
- **Connect emotionally** — Make listeners feel
- **Fit the melody** — Words and music work together
- **Are memorable** — Phrases that stick

**The goal:** Make listeners feel understood.

---

## Show, Don't Tell

### The Golden Rule

**Telling:** "I'm sad"
**Showing:** "I'm staring at your side of the bed"

**Telling states the emotion.
Showing creates the emotion.**

### How to Show

| Telling | Showing |
|---------|---------|
| I'm heartbroken | I still pour two cups of coffee |
| I love you | I'd walk through fire for you |
| I'm lonely | The silence is so loud |
| I'm angry | My hands are shaking |
| I miss you | Your shirt still smells like you |

### Sensory Details

**Engage the senses:**
- **Sight:** Colors, images, places
- **Sound:** What they hear
- **Touch:** Textures, temperature
- **Smell:** Triggers memory
- **Taste:** Specific, evocative

**The more specific, the more universal.** (Paradoxically)

---

## Imagery and Metaphor

### Why Metaphor Works

Metaphors connect the abstract to the concrete:
- "Love is a battlefield" (love = war)
- "Heart of stone" (emotion = physical)
- "Drowning in your eyes" (emotion = water)

### Extended Metaphor

**One metaphor carried through the song:**

Pick a concept (love, loss, hope) and compare it to something concrete (ocean, fire, journey, seasons). Use that comparison throughout.

**Example:** Love as a journey
- Verse 1: Starting the road
- Verse 2: Getting lost
- Chorus: The destination
- Bridge: The detours

### Fresh vs. Cliché

| Cliché (Avoid) | Fresh (Better) |
|----------------|----------------|
| Heart on fire | Chest full of sparks |
| Tears like rain | Salt stinging my cheeks |
| Broken heart | Cracked right down the center |
| Walking on sunshine | Feet barely touching ground |

**Take clichés and twist them** — or avoid entirely.

## Song Structure and Lyrics

### Verse Lyrics

**Purpose:** Tell the story, set the scene, develop the narrative.

**Characteristics:**
- More detail and description
- Moves the story forward
- Each verse reveals something new
- More conversational tone
- Can have more words/syllables

**Verse 1:** Sets up the situation
**Verse 2:** Develops, reveals more, shows change

### Chorus Lyrics

**Purpose:** Deliver the main message, emotional core, hook.

**Characteristics:**
- Simpler language
- More universal/relatable
- Contains the title (usually)
- Repeats throughout song
- Fewer words, more impact

**The chorus is what people remember and sing along to.**

### Pre-Chorus Lyrics

**Purpose:** Bridge verse to chorus, build anticipation.

**Characteristics:**
- Transitional
- Building emotion
- Often rhymes with chorus
- Sets up the chorus revelation

### Bridge Lyrics

**Purpose:** New perspective, twist, different angle.

**Characteristics:**
- Something new (not verse or chorus)
- Often a revelation or turn
- Can be more personal/direct
- Breaks the pattern

## Rhyme

### Rhyme Types

| Type | Example | Use |
|------|---------|-----|
| Perfect rhyme | Love/above, day/way | Strong, obvious |
| Near rhyme (slant) | Love/enough, time/mine | Subtle, modern |
| Internal rhyme | Within the same line | Adds interest |
| Multisyllabic | Believing/deceiving | Sophisticated |

### Rhyme Schemes

**Common schemes:**
- **AABB:** Couplets (line 1 rhymes with 2, 3 with 4)
- **ABAB:** Alternating (1 with 3, 2 with 4)
- **ABCB:** Just 2nd and 4th rhyme
- **XAXA:** Only some lines rhyme

### Rhyme Tips

**Don't force rhymes:**
- Bad: Changing meaning to fit a rhyme
- Good: Finding natural rhymes that serve the story

**Use near rhyme:**
- Opens up options
- Sounds more natural
- Modern approach

**Rhyme important words:**
- Rhymes emphasize words
- Put meaningful words at line ends

---

## Rhythm and Flow

### Syllables and Stress

**Match syllable stress to musical stress:**

| Natural speech | Musical stress |
|----------------|----------------|
| "a-ROUND" | Note on strong beat |
| "to-GE-ther" | Stressed syllable on downbeat |

### Line Length

**Varying line lengths creates interest:**
- Short line: Punchy, impactful
- Long line: Conversational, flowing
- Mix both: Dynamic

### Breathing Room

**Leave space for:**
- Musical breathing
- Emotional impact
- The singer
- The listener to absorb

**Don't cram every beat with words.**

---

## Writing About Emotions

### Universal vs. Specific

**Paradox:** The more specific you are, the more universal it feels.

**Too general:** "I miss you so much"
**Specific:** "I still reach for you when I wake up"

**Specific details trigger universal emotions.**

### Emotional Truth

**Write what's true to you:**
- You don't have to be literal
- But be emotionally honest
- Listeners can sense authenticity

### Finding Your Angle

**Don't just say "I love you." Ask:**
- What KIND of love?
- What MOMENT captures it?
- What's UNIQUE about this love?
- What DETAIL makes it real?

---

## Point of View

### First Person (I/Me)

**Most common in songs:**
- Personal, intimate
- Direct emotional connection
- "I can't stop thinking about you"

### Second Person (You)

**Talking to someone:**
- Confrontational or romantic
- Creates immediacy
- "You broke my heart"

### Third Person (He/She/They)

**Storytelling mode:**
- More observational
- Creates distance
- Good for narrative songs
- "She walks in beauty"

### Shifting POV

**Can change between sections:**
- Verse: Third person (story)
- Chorus: First person (reaction)

---

## The Title

### Title Placement

**Where to put the title:**
- First line of chorus (most common)
- Last line of chorus
- Both first and last
- Throughout (repetition)

### Title Types

| Type | Example | Effect |
|------|---------|--------|
| Statement | "I Will Always Love You" | Direct, clear |
| Question | "Where Is the Love?" | Engaging |
| Image | "Purple Rain" | Evocative |
| Phrase | "Rolling in the Deep" | Intriguing |
| Single word | "Hello" | Simple, powerful |

### Finding Good Titles

**Titles can come from:**
- The hook/main phrase
- An interesting line in the lyric
- The central metaphor
- A phrase you hear in conversation
- A twist on a common expression

---

## Editing Lyrics

### The Revision Process

**First draft:** Get it out, don't judge
**Second draft:** Shape and structure
**Third draft:** Word choice and detail
**Final draft:** Polish and tighten

### Questions to Ask

For each line:
- Does this serve the song?
- Is this the best word choice?
- Is this showing or telling?
- Does this move the story forward?
- Would anything change if I cut this?

### Cutting

**If you can remove something without losing meaning, remove it.**

**Less is more.** Every word should earn its place.

## Writer's Block Solutions

### When Stuck

| Technique | How It Works |
|-----------|--------------|
| Object writing | Describe an object using senses for 10 min |
| Stream of consciousness | Write without stopping for 10 min |
| Constraint | "Write using only 1-syllable words" |
| Perspective shift | Write from someone else's viewpoint |
| Start from middle | Write verse 2 first |
| Use a template | Fill in blanks of existing structure |

### Prompts to Try

- Write about a specific memory
- Write a letter you'll never send
- Write from the perspective of an object
- Write the opposite of how you feel
- Finish this phrase: "The last time I..."

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Problem | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Clichés | Feels unoriginal | Twist clichés or find fresh images |
| Telling not showing | No emotional impact | Use imagery and specifics |
| Forced rhyme | Sounds awkward | Use near rhyme, prioritize meaning |
| Too many words | Cluttered, hard to sing | Edit ruthlessly |
| Too vague | Doesn't connect | Get specific |
| Wrong syllable stress | Sounds unnatural | Speak it out loud |
| No clear message | Confusing | Know what you're saying |

---

## Exercise: Write a Verse

**Step 1: Pick an emotion**
What do you want the listener to feel?

**Step 2: Find a moment**
What specific moment captures that emotion?

**Step 3: Engage senses**
What did you see/hear/feel/smell in that moment?

**Step 4: Write 4 lines**
- Line 1: Set the scene
- Line 2: Add a detail
- Line 3: The feeling starts
- Line 4: The realization

**Step 5: Check it**
- Am I showing, not telling?
- Is it specific?
- Does it flow when spoken?
