# Co-Writing Guide

Writing songs with other people — doubling your creativity.

---

## Why Co-Write

**Benefits:**
- Different perspectives and ideas
- Complementary strengths (you do lyrics, they do melody)
- Accountability (scheduled sessions)
- Learn from other writers
- More fun than writing alone
- Better songs (often)

**The math:** Two brains with different experiences = more options.

## Finding Co-Writers

### Where to Look

**Local:**
- Open mics
- Songwriter circles/meetups
- Music schools/classes
- Local music scene

**Online:**
- Songwriter forums
- Discord servers (music production communities)
- Social media (Instagram, Twitter)
- Collaboration platforms (Kompoz, Splice, Soundtrap)

**Industry:**
- Publisher writing rooms
- Songwriting camps
- ASCAP/BMI workshops

### What to Look For

**Good co-writer traits:**
- Reliable (shows up, follows through)
- Ego in check (best idea wins)
- Different strengths than you
- Similar work ethic
- Open to feedback
- Good communicator

**Red flags:**
- Flaky, cancels often
- Dismisses your ideas
- Won't compromise
- Unclear about splits
- Takes credit unfairly

---

## Before the Session

### Discuss Expectations

**Clarify upfront:**
- What are we writing? (genre, vibe, purpose)
- How will we split credit?
- Who owns what?
- Timeline and deadlines?
- Who does what after (demo, pitch)?

### Standard Splits

| Scenario | Typical Split |
|----------|---------------|
| Equal contribution | 50/50 |
| Three writers, equal | 33/33/34 |
| One person does most | Negotiate fairly |
| Topliner + producer | 50/50 is common |

**Get it in writing.** Even a text message confirming the split.

### Prepare

**Before the session:**
- Bring ideas (titles, concepts, voice memos)
- Know the vibe/direction
- Have your tools ready
- Open mindset

---

## During the Session

### Starting the Write

**Opening approaches:**

**Concept first:**
- Discuss what the song is about
- Agree on the story/emotion
- Start writing to that

**Title first:**
- Share title ideas
- Pick one that excites both
- Build from there

**Track first:**
- One person plays progression or beat
- Other starts melodies/lyrics
- Build together

**Free jam:**
- Just play and sing
- Record everything
- Find moments to develop

### Communication

**Healthy dynamics:**
- "I love that, what if we also..."
- "That's cool, can we try..."
- "I'm not feeling that, but what about..."
- Build on ideas, don't just shut down

**Avoid:**
- "No, that's wrong"
- Taking over completely
- Going silent when you disagree
- Being precious about your ideas

### The Yes And Approach

From improv comedy:
1. Accept what's offered ("Yes")
2. Add to it ("And")
3. Build together

**Example:**
- Writer A: "What if the verse starts quiet?"
- Writer B: "Yes, and then the pre-chorus builds with just drums..."

### When You're Stuck

- Take a break
- Work on a different section
- Switch roles (you do chords, they do melody)
- Record what you have, come back fresh
- Don't force it

### Document Everything

**Record the session:**
- Voice memos running
- DAW recording
- Video if helpful

**Notes:**
- Who contributed what (for later)
- Ideas that didn't make it (for other songs)

---

## Remote Co-Writing

### Tools You Need

**Communication:**
- Video call (Zoom, FaceTime, Google Meet)
- Screen sharing
- Good audio setup

**Collaboration:**
- Shared DAW sessions (Splice, Audiomovers)
- Cloud storage (Dropbox, Google Drive)
- Real-time collaboration (Soundtrap, BandLab)

### Making It Work

**Tips for remote:**
- Good internet connection
- Headphones (avoid feedback)
- Camera on (see each other)
- One person drives the DAW
- Take turns sharing screen
- Send stems between sessions

**Async collaboration:**
- One person starts, sends files
- Other person adds their part
- Back and forth until done
- Works but slower

## Common Scenarios

### Lyricist + Melodist

**Division:**
- One focuses on words
- One focuses on tune
- Collaborate on both

**Tips:**
- Melodist: Leave space for lyrics
- Lyricist: Write to the rhythm
- Both: Stay flexible

### Topliner + Producer

**Division:**
- Producer creates track (chords, beat, vibe)
- Topliner writes melody and lyrics on top

**Tips:**
- Producer: Give topliners choices (different sections)
- Topliner: Don't change the track too much
- Both: Communicate about what's working

### Equal Contributors

**When both do everything:**
- Trade off leading
- Build on each other's ideas
- Stay ego-free
- Celebrate shared wins

---

## After the Session

### Immediate Follow-Up

**Same day:**
- Bounce a rough demo
- Share with each other
- Confirm the split (in writing)
- Note any unfinished parts

### Finishing the Song

**Decide:**
- Who produces the demo?
- Who does what revisions?
- Timeline for completion

**Stay accountable:**
- Set deadlines
- Check in regularly
- Finish what you start

### Rights and Registration

**Register your song:**
- Add to your PRO (ASCAP, BMI, SESAC)
- Both writers register separately
- Match the agreed split

## Difficult Situations

### Creative Disagreements

**When you disagree:**
- Try both versions
- Sleep on it
- Trust the song (what does it need?)
- Compromise if possible
- Know when to let go

### Unequal Contribution

- Learn for next time

### Split Disputes
