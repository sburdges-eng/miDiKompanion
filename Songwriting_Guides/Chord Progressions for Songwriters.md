# Chord Progressions for Songwriters

Understanding harmony and using chords to create emotion.

---

## Chord Basics

### What Are Chords

Chords are multiple notes played together. They create the harmonic foundation of your song.

### Major vs. Minor

| Type | Sound | Emotion |
|------|-------|---------|
| Major | Bright, open | Happy, uplifting, confident |
| Minor | Dark, tense | Sad, emotional, serious |

### The Number System

Instead of note names, use numbers (works in any key):

**In any major key:**
| Number | Name | Quality |
|--------|------|---------|
| I | Tonic | Major |
| ii | Supertonic | Minor |
| iii | Mediant | Minor |
| IV | Subdominant | Major |
| V | Dominant | Major |
| vi | Submediant | Minor |
| vii° | Leading tone | Diminished |

**Example in C major:**
- I = C
- ii = Dm
- iii = Em
- IV = F
- V = G
- vi = Am
- vii° = B°

## Understanding Chord Function

### Tonic (Home)

**I chord = Home base**
- Feels stable, resolved
- Start and end here
- "Resting place"

### Dominant (Tension)

**V chord = Creates pull toward home**
- Wants to resolve to I
- Creates anticipation
- Often used before chorus

### Subdominant (Movement)

**IV chord = Movement away from home**
- Not as tense as V
- Feels open, spacious
- Very versatile

### Relative Minor

**vi chord = Emotional depth**
- Related to I (shares notes)
- Adds emotional color
- Bridge between major and minor feel

---

## Building Progressions

### Basic Formula

**Start:** I (establish home)
**Move:** IV or vi (create movement)
**Build:** V (create tension)
**Resolve:** I (return home) or vi (emotional resolution)

### Verse vs. Chorus Progressions

**Verse:** Can be more complex, wandering
**Chorus:** Often simpler, stronger resolution

**Example:**
- Verse: I - iii - vi - IV (exploratory)
- Chorus: I - V - vi - IV (strong, resolved)

### Adding Interest

**Substitute chords:**
- Use ii instead of IV
- Use iii instead of I
- Use VII instead of V (in minor)

**Add extensions:**
- Add 7ths: Cmaj7, Dm7, G7
- Add 9ths: Cadd9, Dadd9
- Sus chords: Csus4, Gsus2

---

## Key Changes (Modulation)

### When to Modulate

- Final chorus (lift energy)
- Bridge (new perspective)
- After instrumental break

### Common Modulations

**Up a half step:**
```
Song in C → Final chorus in C#/Db
```
*Feel: Energy lift, "truck driver" modulation*

**Up a whole step:**
```
Song in C → Final chorus in D
```
*Feel: Strong lift*

**To relative minor/major:**
```
Song in C → Bridge in Am (or vice versa)
```
*Feel: Emotional shift, natural*

**To IV:**
```
Song in C → Bridge in F
```
*Feel: Opens up, expansive*

### How to Modulate

**Sudden:** Just jump to new key (bold, dramatic)
**Pivot chord:** Use a chord that exists in both keys
**Dominant approach:** Use V of new key to lead in

## Voice Leading

### What Is Voice Leading

How individual notes move from chord to chord.

**Good voice leading:** Notes move smoothly, small intervals
**Bad voice leading:** Notes jump around awkwardly

### Tips

- Keep common tones (notes in both chords)
- Move other notes by step when possible
- Avoid parallel 5ths/octaves (sounds bare)
- Lead melody notes smoothly

### Example

**Jumpy:**
```
C (C-E-G) → F (F-A-C) → G (G-B-D)
All notes jump
```

**Smooth:**
```
C (E-G-C) → F (F-A-C) → G (D-G-B)
Common tones stay, others move by step
```
