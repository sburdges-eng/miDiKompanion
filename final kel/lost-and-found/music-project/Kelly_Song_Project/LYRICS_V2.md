# WHEN I FOUND YOU
## Revised Lyrics - Version 2
### Applying techniques from Cohen, Elliott Smith, Isbell, Oliver

---

## STRUCTURE REMINDER
Every line should sound like falling in love until the final couplet breaks everything open.

---

### VERSE 1
*(Fingerpicked, intimate - establishing the misdirection)*

```
I showed up at your door with nothing left
You were already there, eyes holding mine
Just a lamp between us, the world shut out
I swear I felt my whole life rearrange
```

**Changes made:**
- "Showed up at your door" more specific than "ran to you"
- "Eyes holding mine" - active verb, more intimate than "eyes already knew"
- "World shut out" - stronger verb than "no world outside"
- "Felt my whole life rearrange" - earns the emotional weight, sounds like falling in love AND like trauma

---

### VERSE 2
*(Building slightly - deepening the misdirection)*

```
I reached for you, desperate for your breath
First time I saw all of you, skin and bone
Shea butter sweet, still warm against your hair
I broke in front of you and didn't care
```

**Changes made:**
- "Desperate for your breath" - kept, this line is perfect
- "Skin and bone" - more visceral than "nothing left", adds body/tactile sense
- "Still warm" - added temperature, sensory grounding, also works as misdirection (warmth of intimacy vs. body still warm)
- "Broke in front of you and didn't care" - stronger verb than "fell apart," plus "didn't care" adds vulnerability of intimacy

---

### CHORUS
*(Fuller strumming - the overwhelming feeling, sounds like first love)*

```
I couldn't breathe, I couldn't stand
I hit the floor, I hit the floor
Everything I never knew I'd missed
Rushed through me like a closing door
```

**Changes made:**
- Repetition of "I hit the floor" - Elliott Smith technique, simple repetition hits harder than elaboration
- "Everything I never knew I'd missed" - captures both: longing for love you didn't know you wanted / grief for what's now gone
- "Rushed through me like a closing door" - unusual simile. A closing door is final, sudden, trapping you inside the moment. Works for love (being sealed in) and death (finality)

---

### VERSE 3
*(Pulled way back - almost whispered, the quiet before the turn)*

```
We stayed like that, not a single sound
The kind of still that swallows you whole
I would have lived forever in that room
Just you and me, your eyes still holding mine
```

**Changes made:**
- "We stayed like that" - implies togetherness (misdirection) but also stillness of death
- "The kind of still that swallows you whole" - "still" instead of "quiet" (double meaning: motionless AND silent)
- "Would have lived forever" - brutal irony given context
- "Eyes still holding mine" - callback to verse 1, "still" doing double duty again (continuous AND motionless)

---

### BRIDGE
*(Sustained, the present bleeding through)*

```
Your silence carved a hole
Your absence takes its toll
```

**Changes made:**
- "Carved" instead of "left" - stronger verb, implies violence and permanence
- Your original "still takes its toll" became "takes its toll" - removed "still" to avoid repetition since we're using it elsewhere; present tense is enough

---

### FINAL - THE REVEAL
*(Stripped bare - the turn. Everything breaks.)*

```
You weren't resting—you were already gone
And the woman I found is the one who haunts me now
```

**Changes made:**
- "Weren't resting" - plays on "sleeping" from title (When I Found You Sleeping becomes: I didn't find you sleeping, I found you dead)
- "The woman I found" - direct, not "woman of my dreams" which is a cliché. "Found" echoes the title and the act of discovery
- "Haunts me now" - present tense, immediate, ongoing. Not past. This is still happening.

---

### ALTERNATE FINAL COUPLET OPTIONS
*(Choose what hits hardest when you sing it)*

**Option A (above):**
```
You weren't resting—you were already gone
And the woman I found is the one who haunts me now
```

**Option B (more compressed):**
```
You weren't waiting—you were gone
Now the only place I find you is the dark
```

**Option C (using your original direction):**
```
You weren't sleeping—you were already gone
Now the woman of my dreams won't let me wake
```

## FULL REVISED LYRICS

```
VERSE 1
I showed up at your door with nothing left
You were already there, eyes holding mine
Just a lamp between us, the world shut out
I swear I felt my whole life rearrange

VERSE 2
I reached for you, desperate for your breath
First time I saw all of you, skin and bone
Shea butter sweet, still warm against your hair
I broke in front of you and didn't care

CHORUS
I couldn't breathe, I couldn't stand
I hit the floor, I hit the floor
Everything I never knew I'd missed
Rushed through me like a closing door

VERSE 3
We stayed like that, not a single sound
The kind of still that swallows you whole
I would have lived forever in that room
Just you and me, your eyes still holding mine

BRIDGE
Your silence carved a hole
Your absence takes its toll

FINAL
You weren't resting—you were already gone
And the woman I found is the one who haunts me now
```

## TECHNICAL NOTES ON REVISION

**Verbs strengthened:**
- "ran" → "showed up" (more specific)
- "knew" → "holding" (active, continuous)
- "fell apart" → "broke" (one syllable, harder)
- "left" → "carved" (violent, permanent)
- "won't let me move on" → "haunts me now" (present, active)

**Sensory grounding added:**
- Temperature: "still warm"
- Body: "skin and bone"
- Maintained: lamp (light), shea butter (smell), eyes (sight), silence/sound

**Repetition used deliberately:**
- "I hit the floor, I hit the floor" - Elliott Smith technique
- "Eyes holding mine" / "eyes still holding mine" - bookends verses 1 and 3
- "Still" - used three times with double meaning each time

**What was removed:**
- "For a moment there I swore that I'd arrived" - too explanatory
- "Nothing left" in verse 2 - replaced with more visceral "skin and bone"
- "Thirty minutes" - specific number felt too precise, "stayed like that" is more dreamlike
- Most adjectives and adverbs

**The unsaid:**
- We never say "dead" or "body" or "suicide" or "overdose"
- We never explain the misdirection - we just do it
- The listener discovers the truth the same way you discovered her

---

## WHAT STAYS THE SAME
- The structure and misdirection
- Shea butter
- The lamp
- The thirty minutes of silence (implied now, not stated)
- Her eyes on you
- The core images from your memory

---

*For Kelly. So she's more than that door.*
