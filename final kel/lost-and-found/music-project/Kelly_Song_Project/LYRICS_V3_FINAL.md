## Final Revision - Version 3
### Techniques from masters of emotional scene-setting

## LESSONS FROM THE MASTERS

### CORMAC McCARTHY (The Road, Blood Meridian)
1. **Spare, declarative sentences** - Short sentences carry weight. "It was colder." "He was gone."
2. **Juxtapose the mundane with the transcendent** - Ordinary objects (lamp, shampoo) become sacred
3. **Stripped of ornament** - If it doesn't earn its place, it goes
4. **Details pile up without comment** - Let accumulation do the work, not explanation
5. **Sentence fragments as urgency** - No time or energy for elaboration

### RAYMOND CARVER (What We Talk About When We Talk About Love)
6. **Dialogue that sounds like silence** - What's not said is as powerful as what is
7. **Spare endings loaded with cumulative effect** - Everything hits at once in the final moment
8. **Ordinary life as antagonist** - The everyday becomes devastating
9. **Low-key approach that sucker-punches** - You don't realize the weight until it lands
10. **Staccato rhythm of monosyllables** - Simple words, devastating impact

### WONG KAR-WAI (In the Mood for Love)
11. **Repetition as refrain** - Images that return with unnerving precision
12. **Details that go unnoticed at first** - A curtain, a dress, a lamp. Significance emerges.
13. **What is absent defines what remains** - The spouses are never shown; absence shapes everything
14. **Color and light as emotional language** - The lamp in the bathroom isn't just light—it's everything
15. **Framing that creates distance** - Observe from slightly outside the moment

### JOAN DIDION (The Year of Magical Thinking)
16. **Horror in understatement** - "He fell" is more devastating than describing the fall
17. **Repetition as grief's rhythm** - Phrases return because grief loops
18. **Clinical precision as emotional distance** - Reporting the facts when feeling would destroy you
19. **"Life changes fast. Life changes in the instant."** - Short, flat, true
20. **Fragments shored against ruins** - Structure mirrors psychological rupture

---

## REVISED LYRICS - FINAL VERSION

**Key principles applied:**
- Shorter sentences. Fragments where emotion is too much.
- Remove explanatory language—trust the image
- Let repetition do work (like Wong Kar-wai's visual refrains)
- McCarthy's declarative flatness for the heaviest moments
- Didion's clinical distance that somehow hurts more
- Carver's loaded endings

---

### VERSE 1
*(Spare. Declarative. The misdirection begins.)*

```
I showed up at your door.
Nowhere else to go.
You were there. Eyes already on me.
Just a lamp. No world outside.
```

**Notes:** Broken into fragments. McCarthy-style declaratives. Each line is its own breath. "Just a lamp" does more than "just a lamp between us"—it lets the listener fill the space.

---

### VERSE 2
*(Building. Sensory. The intimacy that isn't.)*

```
I reached for you. Desperate for your breath.
First time I saw all of you.
Shea butter. Still warm in your hair.
I broke. Right there in front of you.
```

**Notes:** "Shea butter. Still warm in your hair." — No verb needed. Didion-style clinical observation that carries the weight. "Still warm" does triple duty: warmth of intimacy, body still warm, the terrible specificity of smell memory.

---

### CHORUS
*(The misdirection at its peak—sounds like love. Carver's "loaded" ending.)*

```
I couldn't breathe.
I couldn't stand.
I hit the floor.
I hit the floor.
Everything I'd never known.
All at once.
```

**Notes:** Fragments. Repetition. "Everything I'd never known" left incomplete—what? Love? Loss? Both. "All at once" lands like Carver's spare endings. No elaboration.

---

### VERSE 3
*(Wong Kar-wai stillness. The details that accumulate.)*

```
We stayed like that. No sound.
The kind of quiet that swallows.
I would have stayed forever.
Just you. Your eyes still on my face.
```

**Notes:** "The kind of quiet that swallows" — incomplete sentence, like grief. "Your eyes still on my face" — Wong Kar-wai's obsessive return to eyes, gaze, looking. "Still" does double duty again.

---

### BRIDGE
*(Didion's repetition. The present bleeding through.)*

```
Your silence carved a hole.
Your absence takes its toll.
```

**Notes:** These two lines are the only ones that explicitly acknowledge present tense, ongoing pain. The shift from "carved" (past, violent, permanent) to "takes" (present, continuous) mirrors Didion's movement from describing the event to living in its aftermath.

---

### FINAL - THE REVEAL
*(McCarthy's spare flatness. Everything breaks.)*

```
You weren't resting.
You were already gone.
The woman I found won't leave me alone.
```

**Notes:** 
- "You weren't resting" — plays against "sleeping" in the title. Simple. Flat. Devastating.
- "You were already gone" — McCarthy's declarative: "He was gone. It was like he had never existed."
- "The woman I found won't leave me alone" — not "woman of my dreams" (cliché). "The woman I found" echoes the title and the act of discovery. "Won't leave me alone" — present tense, ongoing, she's still there.

## FULL SONG - FINAL VERSION

```
VERSE 1
I showed up at your door.
Nowhere else to go.
You were there. Eyes already on me.
Just a lamp. No world outside.

VERSE 2
I reached for you. Desperate for your breath.
First time I saw all of you.
Shea butter. Still warm in your hair.
I broke. Right there in front of you.

CHORUS
I couldn't breathe.
I couldn't stand.
I hit the floor.
I hit the floor.
Everything I'd never known.
All at once.

VERSE 3
We stayed like that. No sound.
The kind of quiet that swallows.
I would have stayed forever.
Just you. Your eyes still on my face.

BRIDGE
Your silence carved a hole.
Your absence takes its toll.

FINAL
You weren't resting.
You were already gone.
The woman I found won't leave me alone.
```

## ALTERNATE FINAL OPTIONS

**Option A (above):**
```
You weren't resting.
You were already gone.
The woman I found won't leave me alone.
```

**Option B (more complete sentences, less fragmented):**
```
You weren't sleeping—you were already gone.
Now the woman I found is the one who haunts me.
```

**Option C (shortest, most McCarthy-like):**
```
You weren't waiting.
You were gone.
I found you. I found you.
```

---

## WHAT CHANGED FROM V2 TO V3

1. **Broke long sentences into fragments** — Each line is a breath, a moment
2. **Removed connective tissue** — "Just a lamp between us" → "Just a lamp."
3. **Let images stand alone** — "Shea butter. Still warm in your hair." No verb, no connector
4. **Simplified chorus** — Fragments instead of complete thoughts
5. **Tightened bridge** — Already tight, kept as is
6. **Flattened final lines** — McCarthy-style declaratives

---

## MUSICAL NOTES FOR PERFORMANCE

**Verse 1:** Almost spoken. Each line separated by breath. Fingerpicking sparse.

**Verse 2:** Same pace. "Shea butter" gets its own musical phrase—let the words hang.

**Chorus:** The only section with any fullness. But even here, restrained. "I hit the floor" repeated should feel like someone hitting the ground twice—or remembering it, replaying it.

**Verse 3:** Pull way back. "The kind of quiet that swallows" can almost be whispered.

**Bridge:** Sustained chords. Let the words carry.

**Final:** Stripped to almost nothing. "You weren't resting" — pause — "You were already gone." The truth, finally said.

## THE UNSAID

We never say:
- Dead
- Body  
- Suicide
- Overdose
- Bathroom door
- Breaking down the door
- Calling 911
- Telling her mother

The listener discovers the truth the same way you did—slowly, then all at once.

*For Kelly.*
*Blonde hair. Green eyes. Flannel and tank tops.*
*A loud laugh that changed her whole face.*
*The woman you found.*
