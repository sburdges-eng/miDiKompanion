## 💡 WHY THIS WORKS

### Three-Tier Psychology

**Free → Express:** Easy upgrade ($11/mo is low friction)
**Express → Complete:** Clear ROI (pays for itself in 5 months)
**Complete → Studio:** Professional features justify premium

### Revenue Model

**Conservative (Year 1):**
```
Free users:     1,000 (viral growth)
Express:          150 × $10.99/mo × 8 months = $13,188
Complete:          80 × $59.99             = $4,799
Studio:            20 × $159.99            = $3,200
                                          ───────────
Total:                                      $21,187
After fees (10%):                           $19,068
```

**Moderate (Year 1):**
```
Free users:     5,000
Express:          500 × $132/year          = $66,000
Complete:         300 × $59.99             = $17,997
Studio:            75 × $159.99            = $11,999
                                          ───────────
Total:                                      $95,996
After fees:                                 $86,396
```

**Mixed Revenue:**
- Recurring (Express): Predictable monthly income
- One-time (Complete/Studio): Upfront cash flow
- Balanced risk (not pure subscription or pure one-time)

## 🎛️ PREMIUM CONTROLS SHOWCASE

### Example: Complete User Session

**User Input:**
```
Emotion: Side A (Grief), Side B (Acceptance)
Key: Ab minor (personal significance)
Progression: Use Andalusian cadence (Am-G-F-E)
  → But transpose to Ab minor (Abm-Gb-Fb-Eb)
Technique: Guitar fingerpicking (Travis picking)
Tempo: 68 BPM (slow, deliberate)
Rule-break: Modal interchange (borrow Fb from Ab Dorian)
Groove: Behind beat (-15ms, represents emotional weight)
Dynamics: Start ppp, build to mf at climax
Justification: "Grief starts quiet, gets overwhelming, 
               then settles into acceptance"
```

**Kelly Output:**
```
Analyzing your intent...

✓ Abm-Gb-Fb-Eb progression (Andalusian transposed)
✓ Fb (natural minor bIV) = "darkness before dawn"
✓ Travis picking pattern generated (thumb bass, finger melody)
✓ 68 BPM with humanization (-15ms avg drag)
✓ Dynamic curve: ppp → mp → mf → mp → p
✓ Emotional arc: Grief (0:00) → Crisis (1:30) → Acceptance (3:00)

MIDI generated with metadata:
- 48 measures, 3:23 duration
- Fingerpicking pattern (3-finger Travis)
- Behind-beat humanization applied
- Dynamic expression map included

Emotional reasoning:
"Your Fb chord (bIV from Dorian) adds 'borrowed hope' 
 - a brief moment of light before the darker Eb resolution.
 The behind-beat timing makes every note feel like effort,
 like grief weighing down your hands. Perfect for this arc."

[Export MIDI] [Refine] [Regenerate]
```

**This level of control:**
- ❌ Not possible in SUNO (too much AI)
- ❌ Not possible in Scaler/Captain Plugins (no emotion)
- ❌ Not possible in Express tier (preset only)
- ✅ Only possible in Kelly Complete/Studio
