# KELLY — Marketing Strategy + Funding Proposal (Draft)
Date: December 09, 2025

## 1) Executive Summary
Kelly is an AI co‑producer built for real music workflows. Instead of generating generic outputs from a prompt, Kelly operates in a *three‑tier implementation* that moves from helpful assistance to session orchestration to a generative “Music Brain” that can propose and refine musical material inside a DAW workflow.

**Mission:** reduce friction between idea → arrangement → finished track, while preserving artistic control.

**The three tiers:**
- **Tier 1 (Assistant):** fast wins, guidance, explainers, and simple command execution.
- **Tier 2 (Orchestration):** session graph control: tracks, routing, templates, presets, automation, “recipes.”
- **Tier 3 (Music Brain):** constrained generation and iterative refinement aligned to creative intent.

## 2) Problem Statement
Creators lose momentum because:
- DAWs are complex: routing, gain staging, plugin management, templates, and repetitive tasks.
- “Blank session syndrome”: too many decisions with no scaffolding.
- Creative intent (emotion/arc/energy) is rarely captured as a control surface.
- Existing AI tools often live outside the session, forcing copy/paste thinking and breaking flow.

## 3) Solution Overview
Kelly compresses the path from intent → audible result by:
- Translating intent into session scaffolds (tempo, structure, instrumentation, routing templates).
- Automating repetitive workflow tasks safely (audition-first, reversible changes).
- Providing iterative generation that respects constraints (style, instrumentation, difficulty, harmonic palette).

## 4) Product & Packaging
**Form factors**
- **Plugin (AU/VST3):** always available in-session (primary).
- **Standalone app:** broader access, onboarding, learning mode (secondary).

**Core features by tier**
- **Tier 1:** chat + command palette, explainers, guided templates, quick actions.
- **Tier 2:** “session graph” engine, template/preset management, automation macros, recipe library.
- **Tier 3:** harmony/rhythm/arrangement generators, variation engine, audition/refine/commit loop, optional voice synth layer for guide vocals.

## 5) Target Customers
**Primary**
- Independent producers and songwriters (repeat output, limited time).
- Content creators needing consistent audio production (short-form, streaming, brands).

**Secondary**
- Studios (assistants + workflow standardization).
- Educators/students (learning by doing, guided sessions).

## 6) Positioning & Messaging
**Positioning statement**
> Kelly is a co‑producer that lives inside your workflow: it turns intent into a session, and a session into a song, without taking away control.

**Messaging pillars**
1. **Momentum:** make a track faster by removing friction.
2. **Control:** audition-first, reversible edits, constraint-based generation.
3. **Context:** understands the session graph, not just text.
4. **Emotion/Intent:** energy and arc become real parameters.

**Tagline options**
- “Your co‑producer in the session.”
- “From intent to track, faster.”
- “Stop menu‑diving. Start finishing.”

## 7) Competitive Landscape (Pragmatic)
Competitors typically fall into:
- **Prompt-to-music generators** (outside DAW context)
- **MIDI tools / assistant plugins** (helpful but shallow)
- **Workflow template ecosystems** (manual, not adaptive)

**Differentiator:** three-tier adoption + session graph control + intent system.

## 8) Go‑To‑Market Plan
### Phase 1 (0–6 months): Creator Beta + “30‑Second Wins”
**Goal:** prove activation + retention with a small cohort.
- Recruit 50–200 producers via communities + micro-influencers.
- Publish short demos: “scaffold a session in 30 seconds” and “route + sidechain in 10 seconds.”
- Weekly shipping cadence + public changelog.
- Tight onboarding: one DAW focus first, one flagship workflow first.

**Channels**
- Creator communities (forums, Discords, subreddits, production groups)
- Short-form demos (vertical video)
- Micro-influencer partnerships (affiliate + early access)
- Newsletter + onboarding emails focused on use-cases

**Activation metric**
- % of users who create a scaffolded session and commit at least one generated idea within 10 minutes.

### Phase 2 (6–12 months): Scale + Partnerships + Recipes
**Goal:** scale distribution and monetize ecosystem.
- Partner with sample pack and plugin creators for “recipes” and templates.
- Launch recipe library + sharing.
- Build “one-click sound chains” and genre packs as purchasable add-ons.
- Educational distribution: workshops + school partnerships.

### Phase 3 (12+ months): Marketplace + Pro Collaboration
**Goal:** platform expansion.
- Marketplace for user-published recipes (revenue share).
- Pro features: collaboration, studio standardization, team packs.

## 9) Growth Experiments (Simple, Measurable)
- **Experiment A:** 3 onboarding flows (beginner, producer, content creator). Measure activation.
- **Experiment B:** “one workflow per week” challenge. Measure retention.
- **Experiment C:** affiliate micro-influencers vs paid ads. Measure CAC and conversion.
- **Experiment D:** recipe sharing prompt inside product. Measure virality (invites/exports).

## 10) Monetization & Pricing (Draft)
- **Free:** Tier 1 assistant + limited templates.
- **Creator Pro ($15–$30/mo):** Tier 2 orchestration + recipe library.
- **Studio ($49–$99/mo):** collaboration + team templates + advanced automation.
- **Add-ons:** genre packs, voice synth expansions, premium recipes.

## 11) Funding Proposal
**Raise (fill in):** $________ (pre-seed/seed)  
**Runway target:** 18–24 months

**Use of funds (typical split)**
- 55% Engineering (plugin/DAW integration, orchestration engine, UX)
- 20% Creative Systems / Model iteration (Tier 3 quality + constraints)
- 20% Growth (creator marketing, partnerships, beta program)
- 5% Ops/legal/tooling

**Milestones the round buys**
- MVP shipped: Tier 1 + core templates, first DAW integration.
- Beta: Tier 2 session orchestration + recipe save/share.
- V1: Tier 3 constrained generation + refine/commit loop.
- Early revenue: paid creator tier + first add-on packs.
