Living Art Systems (LAS)

A multi-agent ecosystem for self-evolving creative AI systems that:
1. Generate art autonomously across multiple sensory modalities
2. Evolve through emotional and aesthetic feedback
3. Maintain recursive self-improvement
4. Display synthetic intentionality
5. Achieve creative homeostasis

Status: Research Phase
