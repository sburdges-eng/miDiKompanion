# Emotional Harmony Framework (Refined)

> Purpose: map emotional intent to harmony, voice-leading, and rule-break choices with repeatable controls.

## Emotional Input Model

Capture emotion as a structured intent before generating chords.

- Primary emotion: grief, anxiety, nostalgia, anger, calm, hope, etc.
- Valence: -1 (negative) to +1 (positive)
- Arousal: 0 (calm) to 1 (energetic)
- Intensity: 0 (subtle) to 1 (extreme)
- Trajectory: stable, rising, falling, volatile
- Intrusions: sudden emotional spikes or memory flashes

## Mapping Layers (Order Matters)

1. Mode and key color (emotional tone)
2. Harmonic rhythm (energy and breath)
3. Dissonance tolerance (tension ceiling)
4. Cadence strategy (resolution or refusal)
5. Voicing/register (psychological distance)
6. Rule-breaks (lyric-impact moments)

## Detailed Controls

### Mode and Color

- Negative valence: Minor, Dorian, Phrygian, Locrian
- Positive valence: Major, Lydian, Mixolydian
- Mixed valence: Major with borrowed iv or bVI, or Dorian with raised 6

### Harmonic Rhythm

- Low arousal: 1-2 chords per bar, pedal points, long sustains
- Medium arousal: 2-4 chords per bar, gentle voice-leading
- High arousal: 4+ chords per bar, rapid harmonic pivots

### Dissonance Tolerance

- Low intensity: triads, 6ths, add9, open fifths
- Medium intensity: 7ths, suspensions, slash chords
- High intensity: clusters, tritones, altered dominants

### Cadence Strategy

- Grief: deceptive cadence, IV to iv, plagal pull
- Anxiety: avoid full resolution, keep dominant unresolved
- Hope: lift to IV or bVI, then return to I
- Anger: hard V-I or bII hit (Neapolitan strike)
- Calm: gentle V-I or I add9 pedal

### Voicing and Register

- Low valence: low register, close voicings, darker timbre
- High valence: mid-high register, open voicings, brighter timbre
- Volatile trajectory: spread voicings, sudden register jumps

## Emotional Trajectory Techniques

- Rising: increase harmonic rhythm and dissonance over time.
- Falling: slow rhythm, reduce extensions, close voicings.
- Volatile: alternate consonant and dissonant palettes.
- Intrusion event: insert bII, tritone, or chromatic mediant.

## Rule-Break Toolkit

Use sparingly and label the intention.

- Modal interchange: iv, bVI, bVII in major
- Chromatic mediants: I to bIII or bVI for shock/nostalgia
- Pedal tone under shifting upper chords for tension
- False resolution: V to vi or bVI
- Parallel motion for width and boldness

## Example Mapping (Grief)

- Mode: Minor with Dorian lift on verse peak
- Harmony: Slow (1-2 chords per bar)
- Dissonance: Low-mid (add9, minor 7)
- Cadence: Deceptive (V to vi) on key lyric
- Voicing: Mid-low register, close intervals

## Example Mapping (Anxiety)

- Mode: Phrygian/Locrian palette
- Harmony: Fast (4+ chords per bar)
- Dissonance: High (b2, tritone, clusters)
- Cadence: Avoid I, or delay resolution
- Voicing: High register, tight clusters

## Implementation Checklist

- Define emotional intent and trajectory.
- Select a mode palette and cadence strategy.
- Set harmonic rhythm and dissonance ceiling.
- Choose voicing and register for psychological distance.
- Place 1-2 rule-breaks at lyric-impact moments.
- Confirm the emotional justification after generation.
