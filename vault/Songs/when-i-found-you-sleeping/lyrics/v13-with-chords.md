## VERSE ONE
*[F - C - Am - Dm]*

```
[F]                     [C]
Shea butter, still warm in your hair

[Am]                    [Dm]
I swear it's still Sunday, I swear you're still there

[F]                          [C]
The clock on the nightstand says three years have passed

[Am]                         [Dm]
But the sheets still remember the shape that you cast
```

---

## VERSE TWO
*[F - C - Am - Dm]*

```
[F]                      [C]
I used to keep calendars, I used to keep track

[Am]                        [Dm]
But the days started bleeding and none of them came back

[F]                    [C]
Is it Monday or Sunday, December or May

[Am]                     [Dm]
I know that time's passing but years feel like days
```

---

## CHORUS
*[F - C - Am - Bb]*

```
[F]                    [C]
When I found you sleeping, my heart hit the floor

[Am]                        [Bb]
I've never felt nothing so strongly before

[F]                     [C]
The woman I found there, she stopped all the clocks

[Am]                      [Bb]
She lives in the morning, she lives where time stops
```

---

## VERSE THREE
*[F - C - Am - Dm]*

```
[F]                       [C]
I wake and it's that morning, I sleep and I'm back

[Am]                    [Dm]
The present's a rumor, the future went black

[F]                       [C]
Old friends keep asking what years have gone now

[Am]                         [Dm]
I don't open my mouth so tears won't fall out
```

---

## BRIDGE
*[F - C - Am - Bb]* ← Bb on the fracture

```
[F]                    [C]
They said it gets better, they said just hold on

[Am]                              [Bb]
But I'm stuck in that morning from fucking dusk fucking dawn

[F]                       [C]
The sun keeps on setting, the world keeps its spin

[Am]                       [Bb]
But I'm in a doorway that won't let me in
```

---

## THE FREEZE
*[Slower? Stripped? Just F - Am - Dm?]*

```
[F]
I see you not breathing

[Am]
I froze where I stood

[Dm]
My body said help her

[Dm]
My body said—

[silence / let ring]

[F]                        [C]
I tell my legs carry me, I tell my arms reach

[Am]                       [Dm]
I tell my voice call out but nothing will teach

[F]                       [C]
My hands know your skin but they won't cross the room

[Am]                       [Dm]
My voice knows your name but it dies before noon

[F]                        [C]
The clock says it's evening, three winters from then

[Am]                       [Dm]
But I'm watching you sleeping, it's Sunday again
```

---

## FINAL VERSE
*[F - C - Am - Dm → Bb on landing]*

```
[F]                     [C]
I see you not breathing, I'm stuck at the door

[Am]                       [Dm]
My legs won't go forward, my voice finds no floor

[F]                  [C]
I'm watching my hands but they won't do what I say

[Am]                          [Dm]
I've been stuck in this morning since you went away

[Am]                           [Bb] ← weight
I'm engrained in this doorway

[Bb] (let ring)
And now it's 2024
```

---

## OUTRO
*[F - C - Am - Dm]* *(return to the loop)*

```
[F]                     [C]
Shea butter, still warm in your hair

[Am]                    [Dm]
I swear it's still Sunday

[Dm] (let ring / fade)
I swear you're still there
```

## NOTES

- Bb hits on the heavy lines: "so strongly before," "where time stops," "fucking dawn," "won't let me in," "2024"
- The Dm pulls back to F — the cycle, the stuck, the loop that won't end
- Freeze section could strip to just F - Am - Dm, slower, letting the incomplete sentence hang
- "And now it's 2024" sits on the Bb and rings out — the weight of realization
