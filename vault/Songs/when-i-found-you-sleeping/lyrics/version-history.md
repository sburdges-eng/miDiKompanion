# V12 — FINAL (Current)

```
Shea butter
Still warm in your hair
I swear it's still Sunday
I swear you're still there

The clock on the nightstand
Says three years have passed
But the sheets still remember
The shape that you cast

I used to keep calendars
I used to keep track
But the days started bleeding
And none of them came back

Is it Monday or Sunday
December or May
I know that time's passing
But years feel like days

When I found you sleeping
My heart hit the floor
I've never felt nothing
So strongly before

The woman I found there
She stopped all the clocks
She lives in the morning
She lives where time stops

I wake and it's that morning
I sleep and I'm back
The present's a rumor
The future went black

Old friends keep asking
What years have gone now
I don't open my mouth
So tears won't fall out

They said it gets better
They said just hold on
But I'm stuck in that morning
From fucking dusk fucking dawn

The sun keeps on setting
The world keeps its spin
But I'm in a doorway
That won't let me in

I see you not breathing
I froze where I stood
My body said help her
My body said—

I tell my legs carry me
I tell my arms reach
I tell my voice call out
But nothing will teach

My hands know your skin
But they won't cross the room
My voice knows your name
But it dies before noon

The clock says it's evening
Three winters from then
But I'm watching you sleeping
It's Sunday again

I see you not breathing
I'm stuck at the door
My legs won't go forward
My voice finds no floor

I'm watching my hands
But they won't do what I say
I've been stuck in this morning
Since you went away

I'm engrained in this doorway
And now it's 2024

Shea butter
Still warm in your hair
I swear it's still Sunday
I swear you're still there
```

But they won't do what I say
I've been in this morning
Since you went away

I see you not breathing
I'll always be here
Frozen beside you
For year after year

I've been in this doorway
Since 2024

Shea butter
Still warm in your hair
I swear it's still Sunday
I swear you're still there

**Changes from V10:** Added "from fucking dusk fucking dawn" — the fracture point where rage breaks through

## V10

```
Shea butter
Still warm in your hair
I swear it's still Sunday
I swear you're still there

The clock on the nightstand
Says three years have passed
But the sheets still remember
The shape that you cast

I used to keep calendars
I used to keep track
But the days started bleeding
And none of them came back

Is it Monday or Sunday
December or May
I know that time's passing
But years feel like days

When I found you sleeping
My heart hit the floor
I've never felt nothing
So strongly before

The woman I found there
She stopped all the clocks
She lives in the morning
She lives where time stops

I wake and it's that morning
I sleep and I'm back
The present's a rumor
The future went black

Old friends keep asking
What years have gone now
I don't open my mouth
So tears won't fall out

They said it gets better
They said just hold on
But I'm stuck in a morning
That should have been gone

The sun keeps on setting
The world keeps its spin
But I'm in a doorway
That won't let me in

**Changes from V9:** "Old friends keep asking / What years have gone now / I don't open my mouth / So tears won't fall out" — active silence, choosing not to speak

---

## V9

**Changes from V8:** "Is it Monday or Sunday / December or May" — question instead of statement; "years feel like days" — time compression

---

## V8

**Changes from V7:** "My heart hit the floor" and "I've never felt nothing so strongly before" — stronger misdirection, double meaning of "nothing"

---

## V7 — TIME COLLAPSED

First full version with time distortion as central architecture. "I swear it's still Sunday" opener. Freeze section expanded. Ending: "I've been in this doorway / Since 2024"

---

## V6 — EMPATHIC GATEWAY

Research made invisible. Misdirection restored. Body memory details (shea butter, temperature, weight) as entry points. Love/grief using same pathways.

---

## V5 — RESEARCH INFORMED

Explicit research integration. Polyvagal states named. "The body remembers what the mind won't say." Too visible — research showing through.

---

## V4 — MASTERS SYNTHESIS

Earlier structural version. Foundation for misdirection concept.

---

# KEY EVOLUTION NOTES

## Core Misdirection
Song reads as love song until reveal. Same language works for both:
- "My heart hit the floor" = falling in love / collapsing in grief
- "I've never felt nothing so strongly" = intensity of love / numbness of trauma
- "She won't let me go" = obsessive love / intrusive imagery
- "I swear it's still Sunday" = time flies with you / time literally stopped

## Time Distortion Thread
- V7: Introduced time as central theme
- V9: "Is it Monday or Sunday" — genuine question, not statement
- V9: "Years feel like days" — compression
- V12: "And now it's 2024" — dissociative realization

## The Fracture
- V11: "From fucking dusk fucking dawn" — first break in controlled surface
- Rage underneath the stillness
- Signals wrongness before reveal

## The Ending
- V12: "I'm engrained in this doorway / And now it's 2024"
- "Engrained" — fused into the wood, permanent
- "And now" — waking up, realizing time passed

## The Freeze (Expanded)
- Incomplete sentence: "My body said help her / My body said—"
- Commands that don't execute: "I tell my legs carry me"
- Body memory: "My hands know your skin / But they won't cross the room"

## Research Integration (Invisible)
- Somatic memory → shea butter, temperature, weight, shape
- Polyvagal states → freeze, "hit the floor," shutdown
- Continuing bonds → "she lives where I go"
- Dual process → oscillation never happens; she's stuck
- Neuroception → "my body knew something my mind never will"
