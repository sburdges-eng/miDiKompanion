## Drawing out the inability to function

## THE MOMENT (Options)

**Option A — Time Stops**
```
I see you not breathing
I freeze at the door
My legs won't go to you
My voice finds no floor

I'm watching my hands
They won't do what I say
I'm screaming inside
But the scream doesn't play

I see you not breathing
I see you so still
My body's beside you
My feet never will
```

**Why it works:** The dissociation — watching yourself from outside. "Voice finds no floor" — the scream that has no ground, no way out. "Screaming inside but the scream doesn't play" — the internal chaos, external paralysis. The body is both beside her (spiritually, desperately) and will never reach her (physically frozen).

---

**Option B — The Loop**
```
I see you not breathing
I'm stuck at the door
I've been in this doorway
For three years or more

My hand's on the handle
It won't turn, won't move
I know I should help you
But what would that prove

I see you not breathing
I'll always be here
Frozen beside you
For year after year
```

**Why it works:** Time collapse — three years compressed into one moment. Still in that doorway. "What would that prove" — the brutal recognition that she's already gone, that nothing could have helped, but the body still won't accept it. "I'll always be here" — the continuing trauma, returning to the scene.

---

**Option C — The Body Won't**
```
I see you not breathing
I froze by the door
My knees hit the carpet
I'm flat on the floor

I tell my arms reach
I tell my voice call
I tell my lungs breathe
But nothing at all

The room's getting smaller
The room's getting loud
I see you not breathing
I see you not now
```

**Why it works:** Commands that don't execute. "Tell my arms reach" — the desperate internal instructions the body won't follow. "Nothing at all" — total system failure. "Room getting smaller/loud" — the sensory overwhelm, panic with no outlet. "See you not now" — dissociation, time breaking.

---

**Option D — Minimal/Repeated (Most Devastating)**
```
I see you not breathing
I froze by the door
I see you not breathing
I'm down on the floor

I see you not breathing
I can't get to you
I see you not breathing
I don't know what to do

I see you not breathing
I see you not breathing
I see you
I see you
I see
```

**Why it works:** The loop IS the freeze. The repetition is the stuck needle. The brain trying to process, failing, trying again. Breaking down from sentence to fragment to single word. "I see" — reduced to just the image. Nothing else functions.

## INTEGRATED VERSION (Full Final Section)

Taking elements from above and weaving into the song structure:

```
[VERSE — The Return]
I go back to that morning
I stand in the door
I've stood in this doorway
Ten thousand times more

[THE FREEZE — Expanded]
I see you not breathing
I froze where I stood
My body said help her
My body said—

                        [silence/breath]

I tell myself go to her
I tell myself move
I tell myself something
But nothing gets through

My hands know your skin
But they won't cross the room
My voice knows your name
But it dies in my throat

I see you not breathing
I'm still at the door
I've been in this doorway
Since 2024

[RELEASE — The Floor]
And then I'm beside you
I don't know how
I'm holding your hand
But you're not here now

The woman I found there
Was already gone
I find her and find her
And find her at dawn
```

## THE SCIENCE (Invisible)

What we're actually describing:

**Dorsal Vagal Shutdown:**
- Freeze response when threat is inescapable
- Body immobilizes, dissociates
- Time perception distorts
- Commands don't reach muscles
- "Playing dead" at nervous system level

**Incomplete Stress Response:**
- The action that never completed (going to her, helping)
- Lives in the body forever
- Loops because it was never finished
- "I tell myself go to her" — the instruction that never executed

**Dissociation:**
- Watching self from outside
- Time collapse (still there years later)
- Fragmented perception
- "I see you" breaking down

**Trauma Loop:**
- Returning to the scene
- Repetition compulsion
- "Ten thousand times more"
- The memory that won't integrate

## WHAT HITS HARDEST

The incomplete sentence:
```
My body said help her
My body said—
```

The silence IS the freeze. The body started to respond and then just... stopped. The dash is the system failure. The breath after is the listener's nervous system recognizing it.

## QUESTIONS TO CONSIDER

1. How long do you want to sit in the freeze? One verse? Two? A whole extended section?

2. The repetition approach (Option D) — is that too experimental or does the breaking-down structure feel right?

3. "Since 2024" — real year or keep it abstract? Real year is more devastating but also more specific.

4. Do we want the "release" moment (suddenly beside her) or stay stuck in the doorway? The teleport from door to beside her captures dissociative time-skip.
