## HOW TO READ THIS SHEET

```
[F]          <- chord change happens HERE
Shea butter  <- sing this text
    ^
    BOLD = stressed syllable
    (uh) = vowel modification suggestion
    * = potential register break point
    // = breath mark
```

**VOWEL KEY:**
- **OPEN vowels** (ah, eh, aw) -> favor CHEST voice, harder to transition
- **CLOSED vowels** (oo, ee, ih) -> favor HEAD voice, easier transitions
- When approaching a break: modify OPEN -> more CLOSED (ah->uh, eh->ih)

---

## TEMPO & FEEL
**~120 BPM** | 4/4 time | Arpeggiated sweep down/up per chord
Each chord = ~2 beats (half measure) or 4 beats (full measure) depending on section

---

# VERSE THREE

                         break point!                    break point!
```

**VOWEL NOTE FOR V3:** The word "mouth" and "out" end this verse. Both have the "ow" diphthong which can cause breaks. Options:
- Keep it chest, let it be raw
- Modify slightly toward "uh" before the "w" sound (muh-outh -> muhth)
- Or lean INTO the break — this is a vulnerable line about not being able to speak

# BRIDGE — THE FRACTURE
*Chord pattern: F - C - Am - Bb*
*Voice: building tension, controlled until it breaks*

```
        [F]                              [C]
        |                                |

        v                v                               v
        open             open                            open - chest


        [Am]                                            [Bb] <- FRACTURE
        |                                               |
But I'm STUCK in that    MORN-ing from   FUCK-ing DUSK  FUCK-ing DAWN
        (stuhk)          (moh)           *****BREAK*****
        v                v               vvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
        closed           closed-ish      THIS IS THE MOMENT
```

### THE FRACTURE LINE — DETAILED BREAKDOWN

```
FUCK - ing   DUSK   FUCK - ing   DAWN
(fuh)  (ih)  (duhsk) (fuh)  (ih)  (daw)*
  v     v      v       v     v      v
closed closed closed  closed closed OPEN
```

**WHY THIS LINE IS HARD:**
- Emotional intensity pushes toward chest/yell
- "DAWN" is an open vowel (aw) at high intensity
- The repetition of "fucking" creates rhythmic momentum that's hard to stop

**VOWEL STRATEGIES:**

1. **Let it break.** The voice cracking on "dawn" IS the grief cracking. The yodel-effect is your body doing what the lyrics describe.

2. **Modify "dawn"** -> Instead of full "aw" (dAWn), let it go toward "oh" (dOHn) or even "uh" (dUHn). This rounds the vowel and helps you stay in control.

3. **Back off volume, increase intensity.** Louder =/= more emotional. Try saying it with gritted teeth rather than shouting. The "uh" in "fuck" is already closed — stay there.

4. **Breath before "fucking dusk"** — a micro-pause after "morning" gives you reset.

# THE FREEZE
*Chord pattern: F - Am - Dm (stripped, slower)*
*Voice: drops to near-speaking, intimate, broken rhythm*

        closed           closed - all closed vowels here = easier

        (bah)*           (hehlp)
        v                v
        OPEN - potential break on "body"
        Consider: (buh-dy) instead of (bah-dy)


        [Dm]
        |
My      BOD-y said—
        (bah)
        v
        THE SENTENCE DOESN'T FINISH
        Let the vowel hang. Don't close it.
        The incompleteness IS the freeze.


        [silence / let guitar ring]

        // BREATH //
```

**THE INCOMPLETE SENTENCE:**
This is your second fracture point. But it's the opposite of the "fucking dawn" moment.
- "Fucking dawn" = rage breaking through
- "My body said—" = system failure, can't even finish
- Let "said" hang. The "eh" vowel stays open. No resolution.

**THE FINAL LINE:**
"And now it's 2024" — the gut-drop. Options:

1. **Stay chest, speak it almost.** The realization is quiet. The weight is in the words, not the delivery.

2. **Let "four" ring.** The "oh" vowel is naturally closed. Easy to sustain. Let the guitar ring under it.

3. **Don't "sing" it.** This might be the one line that's almost spoken. The contrast with everything before makes it land harder.

# VOWEL MODIFICATION SUMMARY

## PROBLEM VOWELS (open = harder through breaks)

| Vowel | Sound | Words in Song | Modification |
|-------|-------|---------------|--------------|
| AH | father | body, clock, watching | -> UH (buhdy, cluhk, wuhtching) |
| AW | law | dawn, call | -> OH (dohn, cohl) |
| EH | bed | help, said, tell | -> IH (hilp, sihd) or keep |
| OW | now | mouth, out, now | -> reduce the W, stay on AH/UH |

## FRIENDLY VOWELS (closed = easier through breaks)

| Vowel | Sound | Words in Song | Notes |
|-------|-------|---------------|-------|
| OO | moon | room, noon, you | Easy head voice access |
| OH | go | door, floor, four, morning | Naturally rounds, good landing |
| EE | see | sleeping, breathing, bleeding | Easy, can go high |
| IH | sit | in, still, will | Closed, stable |
| UH | but | stuck, nothing, Sunday, fucking | Your friend. Closed, easy. |

# REGISTER BREAK POINTS (ranked by difficulty)

1. **"fucking DAWN"** — Open vowel + emotional intensity + momentum. HARDEST.
   - Solution: Modify to "dohn" or let it break intentionally

2. **"My body said—"** — Open on "body" + incomplete sentence
   - Solution: Modify "body" to "buhdy," let "said" hang unresolved

3. **"HEART hit the floor"** — Open "ah" on stressed syllable
   - Solution: Modify to "huhrt" or back off volume

4. **"watching you sleeping"** — Open "ah" on watching
   - Solution: "wuhtching" — close it down

5. **"CALL out"** — Open "aw"
   - Solution: "cohl out" — round toward OH

# THE PHILOSOPHY

From the research:

> "Open vowels (such as 'ah') favor the chest resonance, and the more closed (such as 'oo') favor the headier resonance."

> "When ascending on an 'ah' vowel, let it modify to 'uh' as you go through the break area. This should eliminate the strain and cracking."

> "The voice simply can't work the same way in the upper extension that it does in the lower range."

BUT ALSO:

> "Some students vainly attempt to maintain the same spread mouth position... refusing to allow for the rounding that is necessary... The voice inevitably begins to sound increasingly thinner, 'squeaky' and more strained, or it cuts out completely."

**THE CHOICE:**
- Modify vowels to smooth the breaks = more control, less "yodel"
- Let breaks happen = more raw, more grief, more authentic to lo-fi/emo aesthetic

For THIS song: Consider smoothing most breaks but letting "fucking dawn" and "My body said—" crack. Those are the fracture points. The voice breaking there IS the content.
