# THE SONG

---

## VERSE ONE
*0:00 - 0:23*

```
[0:00] [F]
Shea butter, still warm in your hair
     (buh)                    (heh)

[0:06] [C]
I swear it's still Sunday, I swear you're still there
       (sweh)      (suh)         (sweh)           (theh)

[0:12] [Am]
The clock on the nightstand says three years have passed
    (klahk)                          (yeerz)    (past)

[0:17] [Dm]
But the sheets still remember the shape that you cast
        (shee)                       (shay)       (kast)
```

---

## VERSE TWO
*0:23 - 0:47*

```
[0:23] [F]
I used to keep calendars, I used to keep track
  (yoozd)      (kal)         (yoozd)        (trak)

[0:29] [C]
But the days started bleeding and none of them came back
        (dayz)         (blee)          (nuhn)        (bak)

[0:35] [Am]
Is it Monday or Sunday, December or May
     (muhn)      (suhn)    (sehm)      (may)

[0:41] [Dm]
I know that time's passing but years feel like days
  (noh)              (pas)       (yeerz)        (dayz)
```

---

## CHORUS
*0:47 - 1:10*

```
[0:47] [F]
When I found you sleeping, my heart hit the floor
           (fownd)    (slee)       (hah->huh)*    (floh)
                                   ^ break point

[0:53] [C]
I've never felt nothing so strongly before
         (neh)    (nuh)      (straw->struh)* (foh)
                             ^ modify for control

[0:59] [Am]
The woman I found there, she stopped all the clocks
    (wuh)      (fownd)         (stahpt)       (klahks)

[1:05] [Dm -> Bb on "stops"]
She lives in the morning, she lives where time stops
    (lihvz)        (moh)       (lihvz)          (stahps)
                                                ^ weight chord
```

---

## VERSE THREE
*1:10 - 1:34*

```
[1:10] [F]
I wake and it's that morning, I sleep and I'm back
  (wayk)          (that)           (sleep)       (bak)

[1:16] [C]
The present's a rumor, the future went black
    (preh)        (ruh)         (fyoo)      (blak)

[1:22] [Am]
Old friends keep asking what years have gone now
    (frehndz)    (as)          (yeerz)       (now)*
                                              ^ diphthong

[1:28] [Dm]
I don't open my mouth so tears won't fall out
    (dohnt)        (mowth)*    (teerz)      (owt)*
                   ^           vulnerable line    ^
                   break points — let them happen or modify
```

---

## BRIDGE — THE FRACTURE
*1:34 - 1:57*

```
[1:34] [F]
They said it gets better, they said just hold on
       (sehd)       (beh)        (sehd)        (ahn)

[1:40] [C]
But I'm stuck in that morning...

[1:45] [Am -> Bb]  *** FRACTURE POINT ***
...from FUCKING DUSK FUCKING DAWN
       (fuh-ih  duhsk fuh-ih  daw->dohn)*
                              ^
                    OPEN VOWEL AT MAX INTENSITY

   OPTIONS:
   1. Let it break (yodel = grief cracking)
   2. Modify "dawn" -> "dohn" (rounds the vowel)
   3. Back off volume, keep intensity
   4. Breath before "fucking dusk" for reset

[1:51] [F]
The sun keeps on setting, the world keeps its spin
    (suhn)        (seh)          (werld)      (spihn)

[1:57] [Am -> Bb on "in"]
But I'm in a doorway that won't let me in
          (ihn)    (way)    (wohnt)      (ihn)
                                          ^ weight chord
```

---

## THE FREEZE
*1:57 - 2:20*
*(slower, stripped, broken rhythm)*

```
[1:57] [F — sparse]
I see you not breathing
  (see)         (bree)
  ^ closed, intimate

[2:02] [Am]
I froze where I stood
  (frohz)       (stood)
  ^ all closed vowels = easy

[2:06] [Dm]
My body said help her
   (bah->buh)*   (hehlp)
   ^ modify to stay in control

[2:10] [Dm — hold]
My body said—
   (bah->buh)

   *** THE SENTENCE DOESN'T FINISH ***
   Let "said" hang. The "eh" stays open.
   No resolution. This IS the freeze.

[2:12] [silence — let ring]

// BREATH //

[2:14] [F]
I tell my legs carry me, I tell my arms reach
  (tehl)       (kah->kuh)*        (tehl)      (reech)
               ^ modify

[2:18] [Am]
I tell my voice call out but nothing will teach
                  (kawl->kohl)*    (nuh)        (teech)
                  ^ modify
```

---

## THE FREEZE (continued)
*2:20 - 2:44*

```
[2:20] [F]
My hands know your skin but they won't cross the room
   (handz)       (skihn)     (wohnt)         (room)

[2:26] [Am]
My voice knows your name but it dies before noon
   (voys)        (naym)        (dyz)         (noon)
   ^ diphthongs, but landing on closed "noon" = easier

[2:32] [F]
The clock says it's evening, three winters from then
    (klahk)           (eev)       (wihn)        (thehn)

[2:38] [Dm]
But I'm watching you sleeping, it's Sunday again
         (wah->wuh)*    (slee)        (suh)     (gehn)
         ^ modify
```

---

## FINAL VERSE
*2:44 - 3:07*

```
[2:44] [F]
I see you not breathing, I'm stuck at the door
  (see)         (bree)      (stuhk)       (doh)

[2:50] [C]
My legs won't go forward, my voice finds no floor
   (lehgz)       (foh)        (voys)        (floh)

[2:56] [Am]
I'm watching my hands but they won't do what I say
    (wah->wuh)*   (handz)     (wohnt)           (say)
    ^ modify

[3:02] [Dm]
I've been stuck in this morning since you went away
         (stuhk)        (moh)         (yoo)      (way)
```

---

## THE LANDING
*3:07 - 3:20*

```
[3:07] [Am]
I'm engrained in this doorway
    (grayn)          (doh)

[3:12] [Bb — let ring]  *** THE WEIGHT ***
And now it's 2024
    (now)     (too) (thow) (zehn) (twen) (tee)  (foh)

   This line can be almost SPOKEN.
   The contrast with everything sung before
   makes it land harder.

   Let "four" ring on the Bb.
   The guitar sustains under it.
```

---

## OUTRO
*3:20 - 3:38*
*(return to the loop — the cycle continues)*

```
[3:20] [F]
Shea butter, still warm in your hair
     (buh)                    (heh)

[3:28] [Am]
I swear it's still Sunday
       (sweh)      (suh)

[3:32] [Dm — let ring / fade]
I swear you're still there
       (sweh)           (theh)
                        ^
              Let it hang. Open vowel.
              Unresolved. The loop continues.

[3:38] — END
```
