# PART ONE: THE GENRE LANDSCAPE

## What We're Working In

This isn't one genre — it's a constellation of overlapping scenes that share DNA:

**Midwest Emo / Twinkle Emo**
- American Football, Cap'n Jazz, Owen, The Promise Ring
- Arpeggiated "twinkly" guitar, fingerpicking, open tunings
- Math rock influences, odd time signatures
- Introspective lyrics, suburban ennui

**Lo-Fi Bedroom Emo**
- Teen Suicide, Elvis Depressedly, Salvia Palth, Flatsound
- Recorded in bedrooms on cheap equipment
- Tape hiss, room noise, imperfections as aesthetic
- Raw, unfiltered emotional content

**Confessional Acoustic / Punk-Folk**
- Front Porch Step, Dashboard Confessional, Bright Eyes
- Solo acoustic, simple chords, devastating delivery
- Candid lyrics, emotional rawness over technical skill
- Rooms go silent

**Spoken Word Post-Hardcore**
- La Dispute, Hotel Books, Listener, Touche Amore
- Poetry over music, spoken word into screaming
- Dynamic shifts from whisper to catharsis
- Narrative storytelling, cinematic structure

**Your direction sits at the intersection:** Raw acoustic confessional (Front Porch Step) + fingerpicking/arpeggiated texture (Midwest emo) + lo-fi recording aesthetic (bedroom emo) + fracture/catharsis moments (La Dispute intensity)

# PART TWO: THE LO-FI RECORDING AESTHETIC

## What "Lo-Fi" Actually Means

Lo-fi isn't just low quality — it's a deliberate aesthetic choice that embraces imperfection as authenticity.

**What Lo-Fi Includes:**
- Tape hiss, room tone, ambient noise
- "Imperfect" performances (timing variations, pitch wobbles)
- Audible room acoustics (even if the room is bad)
- Equipment limitations as character
- Blown-out vocals, muddy frequencies
- Single takes over comped perfection

**Why It Works for This Music:**
Lo-fi breaks the fourth wall. Most music is recorded to remove any imperfection in the process of recording. Contrast this to lo-fi, which confronts the listener with the nitty-gritty of the album being assembled in the very fabric of the album; the experience becomes much more personal and raw.

The intimacy comes FROM the imperfection. A perfect recording creates distance. A bedroom recording puts you in the room.

## Recording Philosophy

**What bands in this genre actually do:**

1. **Use the room you have** — Don't fight your space. An untreated bedroom sounds like an untreated bedroom. That's fine. That's the point. One close mic + one room mic = cohesive sound.

2. **Embrace equipment limitations** — Cheap microphones, consumer interfaces, laptop speakers for mixing. These aren't obstacles; they're the sound.

3. **First takes over perfection** — Focus on using the take that sounds the most interesting, warts and all — guitar feedback squeals, snare drum hit inconsistencies and general rhythmic imperfections don't bother me. I'm not trying to impress virtuosic musicians, I'm trying to create something raw, engaging, and honest.

4. **Let noise exist** — Hiss, hum, room reflections. Don't gate everything out. The silence between notes shouldn't be dead — it should breathe.

5. **Mono is fine** — Many classic lo-fi records are essentially mono. Don't feel obligated to create wide stereo fields.

## Specific Techniques

**For acoustic guitar:**
- Single mic, close position (4-8 inches from 12th fret area)
- Don't EQ out the room — it's part of the sound
- String noise, fret buzz, pick scrapes = texture, not problems
- Slight compression to even dynamics, but don't kill the transients

**For vocals:**
- Same room as guitar (bleed is fine, even good)
- Don't pop-filter everything to death
- Breath sounds, voice cracks = humanity
- If it sounds "too clean," you've gone too far

**What to avoid:**
- Over-quantization
- Pitch correction
- Gating out all room sound
- Multi-tracking for thickness (keep it sparse)
- "Professional" sheen

# PART THREE: FINGERPICKING & GUITAR TECHNIQUE

## The Midwest Emo Approach

The "twinkly" guitar sound comes from:

**Arpeggiated patterns** — Not strumming chords, but picking through them note by note, letting strings ring together

**Open strings** — Let open strings drone while fretting notes on other strings. Creates shimmering, bell-like quality.

**Fingerpicking basics:**
- Thumb handles bass notes (E, A, D strings)
- Index, middle, ring fingers handle melody (G, B, E strings)
- Hybrid picking: combine pick and fingers for versatility
- Travis picking as foundation, then add complexity

**Common techniques:**
- Cycling patterns that loop over chord changes
- Letting notes ring into each other
- Using the spaces between notes as much as the notes themselves
- Slight tempo variations (push/pull against the beat)

## Alternate Tunings

Midwest emo uses alternate tunings extensively:

**Common tunings:**
- DAEACE (American Football)
- DADF#AD (Open D)
- DADGAD (Celtic/folk influence)
- FACGCE (Cap'n Jazz)
- Standard with drop D

**Why alternate tunings:**
- Open strings create fuller sound with less effort
- New chord voicings impossible in standard
- Forces you out of muscle memory into fresh territory
- Natural drone notes under melody

## For Your Song

Your progression (F - C - Am - Dm/Bb) works in standard tuning with arpeggiated/fingerpicked approach:

**Sweep pattern at ~120 BPM:**
- Down through strings, back up
- Let notes ring (don't mute immediately)
- Slight variation in timing = human feel
- Don't quantize the picking perfectly

**Fingerpicking option:**
- Thumb on root (F string, C string, A string, D string)
- Index/middle alternate on higher strings
- Let the pattern be slightly inconsistent
- "Sloppy" = organic, not mistakes

# PART FOUR: THE FRACTURE / CATHARSIS MOMENT

## Where Profanity Breaks Through

Your line: "From fucking dusk fucking dawn"

This is the **fracture point** — where the controlled surface cracks and something raw breaks through.

**How this works in the genre:**

La Dispute's approach: They often sound like they're on the verge of erupting. Which makes it all the more satisfying when they do. The restraint makes the release devastating.

**The build pattern:**
1. Controlled, intimate verses (spoken or sung quietly)
2. Tension accumulates through repetition/intensity
3. Something breaks — a scream, a profanity, a dynamic explosion
4. Return to control (or don't — sometimes the ending stays broken)

**Why it works:**
- The listener's nervous system mirrors the performer's
- Quiet trains them to lean in
- The break startles them BECAUSE they're close
- Catharsis is shared — performer and listener release together

## For Your Song

The fracture is already there: "From fucking dusk fucking dawn"

**How to deliver it:**
- Everything before should be controlled, intimate
- This line breaks the pattern — maybe slightly louder, definitely more raw
- Don't oversell it — the profanity does the work
- Return to control afterward ("The sun keeps on setting") makes the fracture more powerful

**The second fracture possibility:**
The incomplete sentence: "My body said help her / My body said—"

The silence IS the fracture. The sentence that can't finish. The system failure.

# PART FIVE: RECORDING YOUR SONG

## What "Sloppier Recording" Actually Means

This genre explicitly values:

**Timing variations:**
- Don't click-track everything rigidly
- Push and pull against the tempo
- Let the breath of the song dictate pace
- Ritardando into heavy moments, accelerando out of them

**Performance "imperfections":**
- Finger squeaks on strings
- Slight pitch variations in voice
- Breath sounds
- Room noise, chair creaks
- The sound of you being in a room making music

**One-take energy:**
- Even if you do multiple takes, keep the energy of a single performance
- Don't comp together "perfect" sections — that kills the continuity
- The slight variations between verses ARE the life in the recording

## Practical Approach

**Setup:**
- Single room, acoustic guitar and voice together
- One mic for guitar, one for voice, or even one mic for both
- Record the room — don't isolate everything
- Minimal processing

**Performance:**
- Play through the whole song, don't punch in
- Let mistakes happen — evaluate after whether they hurt or help
- The fingerpicking doesn't need to be metronomic
- Voice cracks on emotional moments = keep them

**Mixing:**
- Minimal EQ — just clean up mud if needed
- Light compression, if any
- Don't gate out room sound
- Let it breathe

# PART SEVEN: APPLICATION TO YOUR SONG

## What You Have:

**Progression:** F - C - Am - Dm (loop) / F - C - Am - Bb (weight)

**BPM:** ~120

**Guitar approach:** Sweep/arpeggio down and up, fingerpicking option

**Fracture points:**
1. "From fucking dusk fucking dawn" — rage breaking through
2. "My body said help her / My body said—" — silence as fracture
3. "And now it's 2024" — the gut-drop realization

## Recording Approach:

**Option A — Pure bedroom:**
- Single mic capturing guitar and voice together
- One or two takes, minimal editing
- Room sound present
- Imperfections as texture

**Option B — Slightly more controlled:**
- Separate tracks for guitar and voice
- Still single-take performances
- Minimal processing
- Keep the breath and space

**Either way:**
- Don't quantize the guitar
- Don't pitch-correct the voice
- Let the dynamics breathe
- The "sloppy" picking pattern is the human element

## Performance Notes:

**Verses:**
- Intimate, close, controlled
- Fingerpicking or soft sweep
- Voice warm but restrained

**Fracture moment ("fucking dusk fucking dawn"):**
- Slightly more attack on guitar
- Voice breaks free of control
- Then pulls back

**Freeze section:**
- Could strip to voice + sparse guitar
- Space between lines
- The incomplete sentence hangs in silence

**Final line ("And now it's 2024"):**
- Weight. Let it land.
- Maybe guitar stops and voice carries it alone
- Or guitar holds a chord and rings out

# SUMMARY

**Genre:** Lo-Fi Bedroom Emo / Confessional Acoustic / Post-Emo

**Recording aesthetic:** Embrace imperfection. Room sound. Single takes. Tape hiss is fine. "Sloppy" is human.

**Guitar approach:** Arpeggiated sweep or fingerpicking. Slight timing variations. Let strings ring. Don't quantize.

**Fracture/catharsis:** The controlled surface cracks. Profanity, silence, or dynamic shift breaks through. Then return to control (or don't).

**Your song lives here:** Raw acoustic confession with time-distortion structure, fracture points where rage/grief breaks through, lo-fi bedroom recording aesthetic that puts the listener in the room with you.
