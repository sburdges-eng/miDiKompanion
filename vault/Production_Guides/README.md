# Production Guides (Canonical)

Canonical location for production workflow guides used by the codebase and agents.

- Source files are synchronized from `Production_Workflows/` into this folder.
- Prefer the space-named versions when duplicates exist (underscore variants are legacy).
- Guides inform the production integration code under `music_brain/production/`.
