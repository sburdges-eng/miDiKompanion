# Rock Production Guide

Creating powerful, energetic rock tracks with punch and attitude.

---

## The Rock Sound

Key elements:
- **Driving drums** — Powerful, present kit
- **Distorted guitars** — Wall of sound or punchy riffs
- **Solid bass** — Locking with kick drum
- **Energy** — Forward momentum
- **Dynamics** — Quiet to loud contrast

---

## Rock Drums

### The Sound

- Live kit feel (even if programmed)
- Punchy kick and snare
- Driving hi-hats/ride
- Room sound important
- Crashes and fills at section changes

### Programming Rock Drums

**Basic Rock Beat:**
```
Kick:  1   +   2   +   3   +   4   +
       X       X       X       X
Snare:         X               X
Hats:  x   x   x   x   x   x   x   x
```

**Driving Rock:**
```
Kick:  1   +   2   +   3   +   4   +
       X   X       X   X   X
Snare:         X               X
Hats:  x   x   x   x   x   x   x   x
```

### Timing Feel

- Tighter than hip-hop (closer to grid)
- Can push slightly ahead (driving feel)
- Quantize: 75-90%
- Swing: 50-52% (mostly straight)

### Fills

**Rock fills are essential:**
- Before section changes
- Building into choruses
- Around the kit (toms!)
- Crescendo through fill
- Crash on the 1

**Simple fill formula:**
```
| snare-tom-tom-floor-kick | CRASH |
```

### Drum Sound

**Punchy, present:**
- Kick: Click around 3-5kHz, body at 80-100Hz
- Snare: Crack at 200Hz, snap at 2-4kHz
- Toms: Body at 100-200Hz, attack at 3-5kHz
- Overheads: Full kit picture, cymbals

**Room sound:**
- Adds life and power
- Compress room mics heavily
- Blend to taste
- Or use room reverb

---

## Rock Guitars

### Tone Foundation

**Rhythm guitars:**
- Moderate gain (not too much)
- Tight low end
- Mid-focused
- Double-tracked (essential)

**Lead guitars:**
- More sustain
- Can be more gained up
- Centered or featured

### Double Tracking

**Standard rock technique:**
1. Record rhythm part
2. Record it again (different performance)
3. Pan one hard left, one hard right
4. = Huge guitar sound

**If programming:**
- Duplicate track
- Offset timing slightly (10-20ms)
- Slight pitch variation (±5-10 cents)
- Different amp/tone settings

### Power Chords

**The rock staple:**
- Root + 5th (+ optional octave)
- Tight, percussive
- Palm muting between hits
- Strong downbeats

**Programming power chords:**
```
Beat:  1   +   2   +   3   +   4   +
PM:    x   x   x   CHORD   x   x   CHORD
       mute mute mute OPEN mute mute OPEN
```

### Riffs

**What makes a good riff:**
- Simple, memorable
- Rhythmic hook
- Works with drums
- Space to breathe

**Programming tips:**
- Follow kick pattern often
- Accent with drums
- Palm mutes for rhythm
- Open notes for accents

---

## Rock Bass

### The Role

- Locking with kick drum
- Foundation for guitars
- Adds weight without mud

### Programming

**Follow the kick:**
- Bass and kick often hit together
- Creates tight low end
- Some variation for movement

**Tone:**
- Pick attack for rock
- Not too subby (cut below 40Hz)
- Midrange presence (800-1kHz)

**Timing:**
- Tight with drums
- On the grid or slightly ahead
- Creates driving feel

---

## Rock Dynamics

### The Quiet-Loud Dynamic

**Classic rock formula:**
- Quiet verse
- Loud chorus
- Massive contrast

### How to Create Contrast

**Quiet Sections:**
- Clean guitars (or no guitars)
- Minimal drums (or none)
- Soft vocals
- Space and breathing room

**Loud Sections:**
- Distorted guitars
- Full drums
- Doubled vocals
- All instruments playing

### Building Intensity

**Pre-chorus build:**
- Add elements gradually
- Drum build/fill
- Rising melody
- Crash into chorus

---

## Rock Song Structure

### Typical Structure

```
Intro (4-8 bars) — Hook or riff
Verse 1 (8-16 bars) — Story begins, often quieter
Pre-Chorus (4-8 bars) — Build tension
Chorus (8-16 bars) — Hook, loud, memorable
Verse 2 (8-16 bars) — Story continues
Pre-Chorus (4-8 bars)
Chorus (8-16 bars)
Bridge (8 bars) — Something different
Chorus (8-16 bars) — Biggest, possibly extended
Outro (4-8 bars) — Riff out or fade
```

### Arrangement Tips

- Don't give everything away in intro
- Save elements for later sections
- Final chorus should be biggest
- Use breakdowns for impact

---

## Rock Sub-Genres

### Classic Rock

- Blues-influenced
- Less gain on guitars
- Live band feel
- Pentatonic melodies
- Swing in the drums

### Hard Rock

- More gain
- Heavier drums
- Power chord driven
- Big choruses

### Alternative/Indie Rock

- Cleaner guitars mixed with distorted
- More dynamic contrast
- Unusual structures sometimes
- Texture and atmosphere

### Punk Rock

- Fast tempo (160-200+ BPM)
- Simple chord progressions
- Driving drums (constant 8ths)
- Raw energy over polish

### Metal

- Heavy distortion
- Tight, precise playing
- Double kick drums
- Drop tunings common
- Complex arrangements

---

## Mixing Rock

### Drum Mix

**Kick:**
- Cut mud (200-400Hz)
- Add click (3-5kHz)
- Compress for punch

**Snare:**
- Body (200Hz)
- Crack (1-2kHz)
- Air (8kHz+)

**Room:**
- Compress heavily
- Blend for size
- Key to power

### Guitar Mix

**Rhythm guitars:**
- High-pass at 80-100Hz (bass covers low end)
- Cut 200-400Hz (reduce mud)
- Don't over-gain (loses definition)
- Pan hard L/R

**Lead guitar:**
- Center or slightly off-center
- Brighter than rhythm
- Delay and reverb for space

### Bass Mix

**Fit with kick:**
- EQ to complement, not compete
- Kick owns the click, bass owns the sustain
- Or opposite (scooped kick, present bass)
- Sidechain optional

### Vocals

**Rock vocal sound:**
- Present but not over-produced
- Compression (4:1 typical)
- Can be aggressive
- Doubles on choruses
- Room reverb (not too wet)
