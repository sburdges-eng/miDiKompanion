## Song Structure

### Pop Structures

**Most common:**
```
Intro (4-8 bars)
Verse 1 (8-16 bars)
Pre-Chorus (4-8 bars)
Chorus (8-16 bars)
Verse 2 (8-16 bars)
Pre-Chorus
Chorus
Bridge (8 bars)
Chorus (often double)
Outro
```

**Trends:**
- Shorter intros (or none)

- Drop or lift in final chorus
- Short overall (2:30-3:30 is ideal)

### The Hook

**Essential elements:**
- Memorable melody
- Often the title
- Usually in the chorus
- Can also be in pre-chorus or verse

**Hook tips:**
- Simple, singable
- Unexpected note or rhythm
- Repetition works
- Emotional payoff

## Pop Drums

### Characteristics

- Punchy, polished
- Often sample-based
- Quantized tight (or humanized subtly)
- Layered for impact

### The Core Pattern

```
Kick:  1   +   2   +   3   +   4   +
       X       X       X       X      (or syncopated)
Clap/Snare:    X               X
Hats:  x   x   x   x   x   x   x   x
```

### Modern Pop Drums

**Trends:**
- Half-time feel in verses
- Full drums in chorus
- Trap hi-hat influences (rolls, triplets)
- Big, roomy snares
- Clean, punchy kicks

### Processing

**Kick:**
- Punchy attack (3-5kHz)
- Controlled sub
- Tight, not boomy

**Snare/Clap:**
- Cracking, present
- Often layered (snare + clap)
- Reverb for size

**Overall:**
- Compression for punch
- EQ for clarity
- Parallel compression for power

## Pop Bass

### Characteristics

- Supportive, not dominant
- Locked with kick
- Often synth bass
- Clean and controlled

### Programming

- Simple patterns often
- Follows root notes
- Occasional movement
- Tight with drums

### Processing

- Clean and round
- Controlled low end (40-100Hz)
- Sidechain to kick (subtle)
- Not too subby (needs to translate)

## Vocals

### The Star of the Show

Pop is built around the voice:
- Clear, upfront
- Present in the mix
- Heavily produced (but natural-sounding)

### Recording

- Multiple takes
- Stack harmonies
- Ad-libs and doubles
- Punch in for perfection

### Processing

**Chain example:**
1. Pitch correction (transparent)
2. De-essing
3. EQ (clarity at 3-5kHz, air at 10kHz+)
4. Compression (3-6dB, consistent)
5. Saturation (subtle warmth)
6. More compression (optional)
7. Effects (reverb, delay as sends)

### Vocal Production Techniques

**Doubles:**
- Same part, hard-panned L/R
- Chorus especially
- Adds width and power

**Harmonies:**
- 3rds, 5ths, octaves
- Layer on choruses
- Can be subtle or featured

**Ad-libs:**
- Response phrases
- Background texture
- Personality and energy

### Tuning

**Reality:** Pop vocals are tuned.

**Approach:**
- Transparent (don't hear it)
- Preserve vibrato and expression
- Correct only what needs it
- Or go obvious (effect choice)

## Synths and Production

### Common Sounds

- Bright synth pads
- Plucky arpeggios
- Saw leads
- Punchy stabs
- Atmospheric textures

### Sound Selection

**Modern pop:**
- Clean, polished tones
- Not too vintage (unless intentional)
- Width and space
- Movement (automation, modulation)

### Production Layers

**Build your track:**
1. Foundation (drums, bass)
2. Harmonic bed (chords, pads)
3. Hooks (riffs, melodies)
4. Texture (FX, ear candy)
5. Vocals on top

---

## Arrangement Dynamics

### Verse vs. Chorus

| Element | Verse | Chorus |
|---------|-------|--------|
| Energy | Lower | Higher |
| Instruments | Fewer | More |
| Drums | Sparse or half-time | Full |
| Synths | Pad or minimal | Full chords + hooks |
| Vocals | Solo | Doubles + harmonies |

### The Pre-Chorus

**Function:** Build to chorus.

**Techniques:**
- Rising energy
- Increasing intensity
- Drum build
- Filter opens
- Lyrics anticipate

### The Bridge

**Function:** Contrast, new perspective.

**Options:**
- Strip down (breakdown)
- New chord progression
- Different vibe
- Build back to final chorus

### The Drop/Lift

**Final chorus options:**
- Add more layers
- Key change (up a half step or whole step)
- Longer/extended
- Remove elements then add back (drop)

## Mixing Pop
