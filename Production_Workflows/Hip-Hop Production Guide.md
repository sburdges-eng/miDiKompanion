# Hip-Hop Production Guide

Creating hard-hitting, groove-heavy hip-hop beats.

---

## The Hip-Hop Sound

Key elements:
- **Hard-hitting drums** — Punchy kick and snare
- **Deep bass** — 808s or heavy bass
- **The pocket** — Behind-the-beat feel
- **Sampling culture** — Chopped loops, textures
- **Space** — Room for vocals

---

## Hip-Hop Drums

### The Foundation

**Kick:**
- Punchy, present
- Often 808 kick (long, subby tail)
- Or punchy acoustic/sampled kick

**Snare/Clap:**
- Cracking, present
- Often layered (snare + clap)
- BEHIND the beat (15-40ms late)

**Hi-Hats:**
- 16th note patterns common
- Lots of variation
- Rolls and stutters

### Programming the Pattern

**Basic Boom-Bap:**
```
Kick:  1   +   2   +   3   +   4   +
       X           X       X
Snare:         X               X      (late)
Hats:  x   x   x   x   x   x   x   x
```

**Trap-Style:**
```
Kick:  1   +   2   +   3   +   4   +
       X               X   X
Snare:         X               X
Hats:  xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx  (16ths with rolls)
```

### The Pocket (Critical)

**Snare placement:**
- 15-40ms LATE
- This creates the hip-hop feel
- Adjust to taste

**Logic Pro:**
- Select snare hits
- Region Inspector → Delay: +20ms
- Or manually nudge

### Hi-Hat Variations

**Essential techniques:**
- Velocity variation (60-110)
- Rolls (32nd notes)
- Open hats on certain beats
- Pitch variation
- Pan automation

**Roll Programming:**
```
Beat 4: x x x xxxxx (accelerating into next bar)
```
Velocity increases through roll.

### Swing Settings

| Sub-genre | Swing |
|-----------|-------|
| Boom-bap | 55-62% |
| Trap | 50-54% (straighter) |
| Neo-soul/jazz-hop | 58-66% |

## 808s and Bass

### The 808

**What it is:**
- Long, sustained bass note
- Often with initial kick transient
- THE sound of modern hip-hop

### Programming 808s

**Note length:**
- Long, sustained
- Cut before next 808 (avoid mud)
- Or let overlap for legato feel

**Velocity:**
- Fairly consistent
- Accent on important hits

**Pitch:**
- Slides between notes (portamento)
- Glide time: 30-80ms
- Classic 808 technique

**In Logic Pro (using synth):**
- Enable Glide/Portamento
- Set glide time
- Play legato lines

### 808 vs. Kick

**Option 1: 808 IS the kick**
- 808 with punchy attack
- No separate kick needed

**Option 2: Layer kick over 808**
- Short, punchy kick for attack
- 808 for sustained bass
- High-pass the kick slightly to avoid conflict

### 808 Mixing

**EQ:**
- Fundamental around 40-60Hz
- Boost for more sub weight
- Cut around 200-300Hz if muddy

**Saturation:**
- Adds harmonics
- Makes 808 audible on small speakers
- Don't overdo it

**Sidechain (optional):**
- Duck 808 slightly when kick hits
- Creates separation

## Sampling

### Classic Hip-Hop Approach

1. Find source material (soul, jazz, funk records)
2. Chop interesting sections
3. Rearrange into new composition
4. Process heavily

### Chopping Techniques

**Straight loop:**
- Find 2-4 bar section
- Loop as-is
- Add drums/bass

**Chop and flip:**
- Cut loop into pieces
- Rearrange order
- Create new melody

**One-shot chops:**
- Cut individual hits/chords
- Replay as new pattern
- Most creative freedom

### Processing Samples

**Time adjustment:**
- Match to your BPM
- Flex Time in Logic
- Or resample/timestretch

**Filtering:**
- High-pass to remove original bass
- Low-pass for warmth
- Automate filter for movement

**Effects:**
- Saturation/warmth
- Vinyl simulation
- Reverb for space

---

## Melodic Elements

### What Works in Hip-Hop

- Simple, memorable melodies
- Minor keys common
- Pentatonic scales
- Dark, atmospheric pads
- Plucked synths
- Piano with character

### Programming Melodies

**Keep it simple:**
- 2-4 bar loops
- Repetitive (hypnotic)
- Space for vocals
- Not busy

**Sound selection:**
- Dark synths
- Bells, plucks
- Electric piano
- Atmospheric pads

### Chord Progressions

**Common hip-hop progressions:**
- i - VI - VII (Am - F - G)
- i - iv - VII (Am - Dm - G)
- i - VII - VI - VII (Am - G - F - G)
- Simple 2-chord vamps

**Minor keys dominate:** Most hip-hop is in minor keys.

## Arrangement

### Hip-Hop Song Structure

**Typical:**
- Intro (4-8 bars)
- Verse 1 (16 bars)
- Hook/Chorus (8 bars)
- Verse 2 (16 bars)
- Hook (8 bars)
- Verse 3 or Bridge (8-16 bars)
- Hook (8 bars)
- Outro (4-8 bars)

### Beat Drops

**Building tension:**
- Remove drums (2-4 bars)
- Filter sweep
- Riser/reverse cymbal
- Drop back in with impact

**Variations:**
- Half-time sections
- Double-time sections
- Strip to just 808 and vocal

---

## Mixing Hip-Hop

### Drum Bus

**Make it hit:**
- Parallel compression (crush a copy, blend in)
- Saturation for grit
- EQ: boost 100Hz (thump), 4-5kHz (snap)

### 808/Bass

**Dominate the low end:**
- Mono below 100Hz
- Sidechain to kick if needed
- Saturation for speaker translation

### Vocals (When Mixing Vocals)

**Hip-hop vocal sound:**
- Upfront, present
- De-essed carefully
- Compressed but dynamic
- Often doubled or ad-libs panned wide

### Stereo Width

- Drums often centered
- 808 centered (mono)
- Melodic elements can be wider
- Leave center clear for vocals

---

## Sub-Genre Specifics

- Sampled drums (dusty, punchy)
- Heavy swing
- Vinyl texture
