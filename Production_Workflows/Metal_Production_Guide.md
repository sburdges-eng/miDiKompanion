# Metal Production Guide

Creating heavy, powerful, precise metal tracks.

---

## The Metal Sound

Key elements:
- **Heavy guitars** — Tight, powerful, distorted
- **Precise drums** — Fast, technical, impactful
- **Aggressive vocals** — From clean to extreme
- **Low tunings** — Drop D, drop C, lower
- **Intensity** — Energy and power throughout

---

## Metal Guitars

### Tone Foundation

**What makes metal guitar tone:**
- High gain, but not too much
- Tight low end
- Mid presence (the growl)
- Controlled high end

### Gain Staging

**Less gain = more definition:**
- Too much gain = muddy, undefined
- Find the sweet spot
- Clarity over saturation

### Drop Tunings

| Tuning | Notes | Used For |
|--------|-------|----------|
| Standard | E-A-D-G-B-E | Classic metal |
| Drop D | D-A-D-G-B-E | Heavy, palm mutes |
| Drop C | C-G-C-F-A-D | Modern metal |
| Drop B | B-F#-B-E-G#-C# | Djent, heavy |
| Drop A | A-E-A-D-F#-B | Extreme metal |

### Playing Techniques

**Palm muting:**
- Essential for chugging
- Creates rhythmic punch
- Mix muted and open notes

**Pinch harmonics:**
- Squealing overtones
- Adds aggression
- Used for accents

**Tremolo picking:**
- Fast alternate picking
- Creates intensity
- Common in extreme metal

### Programming Metal Guitars

**Rhythm guitars:**
- Tight, on the grid
- Quantize 90-100% (precision matters)
- Palm mutes short and punchy
- Double-tracked (essential)

**Timing:**
- Tighter than most genres
- Locks with kick drum
- Precision is key

---

## Double Tracking

### Why It's Essential

**Metal REQUIRES double-tracked guitars:**
- One guitar panned hard left
- Another panned hard right
- Creates massive wall of sound

### How to Double Track

**Best:** Record the part twice (different performances)

**If programming:**
1. Duplicate the MIDI track
2. Use different amp/tone settings
3. Subtle timing differences (5-10ms)
4. Subtle pitch differences (optional)

### Quad Tracking

**For even bigger sound:**
- Two rhythm guitars (L/R)
- Two more rhythm guitars (50% L/R)
- Different tones for each pair

---

## Metal Drums

### The Sound

**Metal drums are:**
- Fast and precise
- Punchy and powerful
- Often triggered/replaced
- Room sound varies by sub-genre

### Kick Drum

**Characteristics:**
- Clicky attack (3-5kHz beater)
- Tight low end
- Fast, defined
- Double kick capability

**Settings:**
- Attack: Very fast
- Usually triggered or reinforced
- Consistent velocity

### Snare

**Characteristics:**
- Crack and body
- Cuts through guitars
- Often layered with samples
- Ringy or tight (genre-dependent)

### Double Kick Patterns

**Common patterns:**

**Alternating 16ths:**
```
R L R L R L R L R L R L R L R L
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +
```

**Gallop:**
```
R L R - R L R - R L R - R L R -
1 + 2   3 + 4   1 + 2   3 + 4
```

**Blast beat:**
```
Kick:  X X X X X X X X (every 16th)
Snare: X X X X X X X X (every 16th, alternating)
```

### Programming Metal Drums

**Timing:**
- Tight, quantized (85-100%)
- Some humanization on cymbals
- Kicks locked to guitar

**Velocity:**
- Consistent kicks (for triggering)
- Snare variations for fills
- Cymbal dynamics

---

## Metal Bass

### Role

**In metal, bass:**
- Follows guitar riffs (often)
- Adds low-end foundation
- Can have independent moments
- Drives with kick drum

### Tone

**Aggressive bass tone:**
- Distortion/overdrive common
- Mid presence (growl)
- Tight low end
- Pick attack typically

### Playing Style

- Follows guitar parts
- Can double guitar riffs octave down
- Locked with kick drum
- Some fills and variations

---

## Metal Vocals

### Vocal Styles

| Style | Description | Sub-genres |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| Clean | Melodic, powerful | Power, prog, melodic |
| Harsh/Screaming | Aggressive, distorted | Metalcore, hardcore |
| Growling | Low, guttural | Death metal |
| Black metal | High, shrieking | Black metal |
| Mixed | Combines styles | Modern metal |

### Recording Tips

**Clean vocals:**
- Similar to rock
- Powerful delivery
- Wide range often

**Harsh vocals:**
- Proper technique essential
- Microphone distance matters
- Multiple takes for intensity

### Processing

**Clean:**
- Compression (4:1+)
- EQ for presence
- Reverb (often less than other genres)

**Harsh:**
- Heavy compression
- EQ for clarity
- Can layer multiple takes
- Parallel distortion

---

## Metal Production Techniques

### The Wall of Sound

**Creating massive guitar sound:**
1. Double track (minimum)
2. High-pass around 80Hz
3. Cut mud (200-400Hz)
4. Presence boost (2-4kHz)
5. Pan hard left/right
6. Less gain than you think

### Kick and Guitar Relationship

**Essential for tightness:**
- Kick and guitar hit together
- Both high-passed for clarity
- Sidechain possible (subtle)
- They should feel like one unit

### The Scooped vs. Mid-Heavy Debate

**Scooped (cut mids):**
- Sounds big alone
- Gets lost in mix
- 80s metal sound

**Mid-heavy:**
- Sounds smaller alone
- Cuts through mix
- Modern metal approach

**Recommendation:** Keep the mids.

## Mixing Metal

### Guitars

**EQ:**
- High-pass: 80-100Hz
- Cut mud: 200-400Hz
- Cut harsh: 2-3kHz if needed
- Presence: 3-5kHz

**No compression usually** — amp is already compressed

### Drums

**Kick:**
- Click: 3-5kHz boost
- Body: 80-100Hz
- Gate tightly
- Often triggered/replaced

**Snare:**
- Body: 200Hz
- Crack: 1-2kHz
- Snap: 4-6kHz
- Gate and/or trigger

**Overheads/Room:**
- High-pass at 200-400Hz (focus on cymbals)
- Or full kit sound depending on style

### Bass

- High-pass at 40-50Hz
- Distortion for presence
- Sidechain to kick (optional)
- Blend clean and dirty

### Bus Processing

**Drum bus:**
- Parallel compression (crush it)
- Glue compression
- Saturation

**Guitar bus:**
- Light compression if needed
- EQ for final shaping
