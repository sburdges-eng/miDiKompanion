# Lo-Fi Production Guide

Creating that warm, nostalgic, imperfect lo-fi sound.

---

## What Makes Lo-Fi Sound Lo-Fi

The aesthetic:
- **Warmth** — Rolled off highs, boosted lows
- **Imperfection** — Vinyl crackle, tape hiss, wow/flutter
- **Loose feel** — Swung, behind the beat
- **Simplicity** — Few elements, lots of space
- **Nostalgia** — Sounds like old recordings

## The Lo-Fi Drum Sound

### Characteristics

- Dusty, muted
- Behind the beat
- Swung hard
- Simple patterns
- Vinyl/tape texture

### Programming Lo-Fi Drums

**Timing:**
- Quantize: 50-65% (very loose)
- Swing: 58-66% (heavy)
- Snare: 20-40ms late
- Hi-hats: Loose, inconsistent

**Velocity:**
- Not extreme variation
- Slightly compressed feel
- Ghost notes present but subtle

**Pattern Simplicity:**
```
Kick:  1   +   2   +   3   +   4   +
       X           X       X
Snare:         X               X
Hats:  x   x   x   x   x   x   x   x  (swung)
```

### Processing Lo-Fi Drums

**EQ:**
- High-pass: 60-80Hz (remove sub rumble)
- Low-pass: 8-12kHz (roll off brightness)
- Cut 2-4kHz slightly (less harsh)
- Boost 200-400Hz (warmth)

**Saturation:**
- Tape saturation plugin
- Drive it gently
- Adds harmonics and warmth

**Bit Crushing (Optional):**
- Reduce bit depth to 12-bit or 8-bit
- Adds grit and texture
- Don't overdo it

### Drum Sound Sources

- Vintage drum machines (SP-404, MPC samples)
- Acoustic drums with heavy processing
- Layer vinyl noise underneath

## Lo-Fi Bass

### Characteristics

- Warm, round
- Not too subby
- Often simple patterns
- Slightly muted

### Programming

**Notes:**
- Simple root-note patterns
- Occasional octaves
- Not busy

**Timing:**
- Behind the beat with drums
- Shift track +15-30ms

**Velocity:**
- Moderate variation
- Nothing too punchy

### Processing

**EQ:**
- Roll off below 40Hz
- Boost 80-150Hz (warmth)
- Roll off above 3-5kHz

**Saturation:**
- Tube or tape style
- Rounds out the tone

---

## Lo-Fi Keys and Chords

### The Sound

- Electric piano (Rhodes, Wurlitzer)
- Warm synth pads
- Muted, vintage tone

### Classic Lo-Fi Chords

**Jazz-influenced progressions:**
- ii-V-I (Dm7 - G7 - Cmaj7)
- I-vi-ii-V (Cmaj7 - Am7 - Dm7 - G7)
- Descending progressions

**Extensions:**
- 7ths everywhere (maj7, min7, dom7)
- 9ths for color
- Avoid plain triads

### Programming Keys

**Velocity:**
- Soft overall (60-90)
- Gentle variation

**Timing:**
- Loose (quantize 60-75%)
- Chords slightly rolled

**Note Length:**
- Let chords ring
- Overlap between changes

### Processing

**EQ:**
- Low-pass at 6-10kHz
- Slight boost at 200-500Hz

**Effects:**
- Chorus (subtle)
- Tremolo (classic Rhodes)
- Tape saturation

## Lo-Fi Texture Layers

### Vinyl Crackle

**What it adds:**
- Nostalgia
- Warmth
- Fills silence naturally

**How to add:**
- Find vinyl noise samples (free online)
- Loop underneath entire track
- Mix very quietly (-20 to -30dB)
- High-pass at 200Hz (optional)

### Tape Hiss

**What it adds:**
- Analog feel
- Subtle presence

**How to add:**
- Tape hiss samples
- Or generate pink noise, filter heavily
- Very quiet in mix

### Room Tone

**What it adds:**
- Sense of space
- Organic feel

**How to add:**
- Record silence in your room
- Mix in very quietly
- Creates "air"

### Foley/Environmental

**Classic lo-fi sounds:**
- Rain
- Café ambience
- Nature sounds
- City sounds
- Old movie dialogue samples

---

## The Tape/Vinyl Effect

### Wow and Flutter

Pitch instability of old tape:
- Slow, random pitch drift
- Creates organic movement

**In Logic Pro:**
- Pitch automation (very subtle, ±5-10 cents)
- Slow, irregular curves
- Or use tape emulation plugins

### Saturation/Warmth

- Tape saturation on master bus
- Or individual tracks
- Subtle — don't distort

### Filtering

Roll off the highs:
- Low-pass at 10-15kHz
- Creates "old recording" feel
- Don't make it muddy

---

## Lo-Fi Sampling Techniques

### Sampling Existing Music

**Classic lo-fi approach:**
1. Find old jazz, soul, or R&B records
2. Sample a chord loop or melody
3. Chop and rearrange
4. Process heavily

**Legal note:** Use royalty-free samples or clear samples for release.

### Processing Samples

**Time-stretch:**
- Slow samples down
- Creates artifacts (can be desirable)
- Warped, woozy feel

**Pitch-shift:**
- Detune slightly
- Different character

**Heavy filtering:**
- Aggressive low-pass
- Remove original brightness

---

## Lo-Fi Melody

### Characteristics

- Simple, memorable
- Often pentatonic or blues-influenced
- Not busy
- Repetitive (hypnotic)

### Instruments

- Electric piano melody
- Muted guitar
- Soft synth lead
- Sampled vocals (chopped)

### Processing Melody

- Low-pass filter
- Subtle chorus/vibrato
- Tape saturation
- Room reverb (not bright)

---

## Mixing Lo-Fi

### Overall Approach

- Mono-compatible (often narrow stereo)
- Not too loud (dynamic)
- Warm, not bright
- Cohesive, glued together

### EQ Philosophy

**General moves:**
- Roll off above 10-12kHz (master)
- Don't scoop mids
- Warmth in 200-500Hz range
- Control 2-4kHz harshness

### Compression

- Gentle, gluing compression
- Not aggressive limiting
- Keep dynamics

### Reverb

- Short to medium room
- Dark, not bright
- Not too wet
- Cohesive space

### Stereo Width

- Often narrow
- Not wide modern mix
- Mono elements common
- Creates intimate feel

---

## Lo-Fi Master Bus Chain

**Suggested order:**
1. **EQ** — Gentle high roll-off (10-12kHz shelf)
2. **Tape Saturation** — Subtle warmth
3. **Compression** — Light glue (2-3dB max)
4. **Low-pass Filter** — If needed, 12-15kHz

**Don't:**
- Over-limit (keep dynamics)
- Make it too loud
- Brighten the top end

---

## Reference Tracks

Study these for lo-fi production:

- **Nujabes** — "Feather," "Aruarian Dance"
- **J Dilla** — "Donuts" (entire album)
- **Madlib** — "Shades of Blue"
- **Tom Misch** — Earlier lo-fi influenced work
