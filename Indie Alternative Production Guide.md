# Indie & Alternative Production Guide

Creating unique, artistic music outside mainstream formulas.

---

## The Indie Sound

**What defines it:**
- Artistic expression over commercial concerns
- Unique sonic choices
- DIY ethos
- Authenticity and originality
- Imperfection as character

**The irony:** There's no single "indie sound" — it's defined by being different.

- Character over perfection
- The "mistake" might be the magic

- Story over formula

### Be Yourself

- Don't copy mainstream sounds

- Break rules intentionally
- Let weirdness in

## Guitars

### Tones

**Clean:**

**Ambient:**
- Long reverbs
- Modulation
- Swelling volume

### Techniques

- Alternate tunings
- Slide guitar
- Prepared guitar (objects on strings)
- Heavy effect stacking
- Feedback as element

### Processing

- Pedalboard is instrument
- Delay into reverb into more delay
- Modulation stacking
- Don't be subtle (or be very subtle)

### Processing

## Arrangement

### Less Is Often More

- Dynamics come from absence

### Unconventional Structures

**Options:**
