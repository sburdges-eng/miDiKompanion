# Kelly MIDI Companion

**Therapeutic MIDI Generation Plugin**

Kelly translates emotions into music through a 216-node emotion thesaurus and intentional rule-breaking system.

> *"Kelly doesn't need to BE the DAW. Kelly needs to be IN the DAW."*

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- CMake 3.22+
- C++20 compiler (Clang 14+, GCC 11+, or MSVC 2022)
- macOS 11+ / Windows 10+ / Ubuntu 22.04+

### Build

```bash
# Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/kelly-midi-companion.git
cd kelly-midi-companion

# Configure (JUCE will be downloaded automatically)
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

# Build
cmake --build build --config Release

# Plugins will be in:
# - build/KellyMidiCompanion_artefacts/Release/VST3/
# - build/KellyMidiCompanion_artefacts/Release/AU/    (macOS only)
```

### Install

**macOS:**
```bash
cp -r build/KellyMidiCompanion_artefacts/Release/AU/*.component ~/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/Components/
cp -r build/KellyMidiCompanion_artefacts/Release/VST3/*.vst3 ~/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/VST3/
```

**Windows:**
```powershell
Copy-Item -Recurse build\KellyMidiCompanion_artefacts\Release\VST3\*.vst3 "$env:CommonProgramFiles\VST3\"
```

## How It Works

### The Three-Phase Intent System

1. **Phase 0: Wound** - "What hurts?" 
   - Describe your current emotional state
   - The system identifies the core emotional trigger

2. **Phase 1: Emotion** - Map to the 216-node thesaurus
   - Your wound maps to emotions with valence, arousal, and intensity
   - Related emotions form a network of musical possibilities

3. **Phase 2: Rule-Breaks** - "What rules to break and why"
   - Intense emotions trigger intentional music theory violations
   - Dissonance, syncopation, extreme dynamics serve emotional truth

### The Cassette Interface

- **Side A**: Where you are (current emotional state)
- **Side B**: Where you want to go (desired state)

Kelly generates a musical journey from A to B.

## Emotion Thesaurus

The 216-node thesaurus organizes emotions in 3D space:

| Dimension | Range | Effect |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| **Valence** | -1.0 to +1.0 | Mode (minor ↔ major) |
| **Arousal** | 0.0 to 1.0 | Tempo, rhythm complexity |
| **Intensity** | 0.0 to 1.0 | Dynamic range, rule-breaking |

### Categories

- Joy / Sadness / Anger / Fear
- Surprise / Disgust / Trust / Anticipation
- **Complex emotions**: Bittersweetness, Nostalgia, Catharsis, Yearning

## Rule-Break System

| Rule Type | Trigger | Musical Effect |
|-----------|---------|----------------|
| **Harmony** | Negative valence | Dissonance, unresolved tensions |
| **Rhythm** | High arousal | Syncopation, displaced accents |
| **Dynamics** | High intensity | Extreme contrasts, sudden shifts |
| **Melody** | Emotional complexity | Wide intervallic leaps |
| **Form** | Emotional journey | Structural disruption |

## Philosophy

> *"Interrogate Before Generate"* — The tool shouldn't finish art for people; it should make them braver.

Kelly exists because technical perfection is not the same as emotional truth. Sometimes the "wrong" note is exactly right.

This project is dedicated to Kelly, whose memory inspires us to create tools that help people express what words cannot.
