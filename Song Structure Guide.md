# Song Structure Guide

How to organize your song for maximum impact.

## Why Structure Matters

**Structure is the journey:**
- Takes listeners somewhere
- Creates anticipation and payoff
- Makes songs feel complete
- Gives you a framework to write within

**Without structure:** Songs feel aimless, endless, or incomplete.

## The Building Blocks

### Song Sections

| Section | Purpose | Characteristics |
|---------|---------|-----------------|
| **Intro** | Draw listener in | Sets tone, often instrumental |
| **Verse** | Tell the story | Develops narrative, lower energy |
| **Pre-Chorus** | Build to chorus | Creates anticipation, transitional |
| **Chorus** | Main message | Hook, highest energy, repeats |
| **Bridge** | New perspective | Contrast, often one time only |
| **Outro** | Close the song | Resolution, fade, or final statement |

### Section Energy Levels

```
Energy:
High   |           ████████           ████████████
       |       ████        ████   ████            ████
       |   ████                ███                    ███
Low    |███                                              █
       +------------------------------------------------→
         Intro V1  Pre Ch  V2  Pre Ch  Br  Ch    Outro
```

## Common Song Structures

### Verse-Chorus (Most Common)

```
Intro → Verse 1 → Chorus → Verse 2 → Chorus → Bridge → Chorus → Outro
```

**Use for:** Pop, rock, country, most commercial music

**Why it works:**
- Chorus repetition = memorability
- Verses develop story
- Bridge provides variety

### Verse-Chorus with Pre-Chorus

```
Intro → Verse 1 → Pre-Chorus → Chorus → Verse 2 → Pre-Chorus → Chorus → Bridge → Chorus → Outro
```

**Use for:** Pop, building songs, emotional songs

**Why it works:**
- Pre-chorus builds anticipation
- Makes chorus hit harder
- More dynamic journey

### AABA (Classic)

```
A (Verse) → A (Verse) → B (Bridge) → A (Verse)
```

**Use for:** Jazz standards, classic pop, singer-songwriter

**Why it works:**
- Simple and elegant
- Bridge provides contrast
- Returns to familiar territory

### Verse-Pre-Chorus-Chorus-Post-Chorus

```
Verse → Pre-Chorus → Chorus → Post-Chorus → Verse → Pre-Chorus → Chorus → Post-Chorus → Bridge → Chorus → Post-Chorus
```

**Use for:** Modern pop, EDM-influenced pop

**Why it works:**
- Multiple hooks
- Extended chorus section
- Keeps energy high

### Through-Composed (No Repeats)

```
Section A → Section B → Section C → Section D...
```

**Use for:** Art songs, progressive rock, storytelling songs

**Why it works:**
- Constant evolution
- Suits narrative arcs
- Unpredictable

## Section Lengths

### Standard Bar Counts

| Section | Typical Length |
|---------|----------------|
| Intro | 4-8 bars |
| Verse | 8-16 bars |
| Pre-Chorus | 4-8 bars |
| Chorus | 8-16 bars |
| Bridge | 8 bars |
| Outro | 4-8 bars |

### When to Break the Rules

- **Shorter:** Creates urgency, surprise
- **Longer:** Builds more, develops more
- **Odd numbers:** Creates interest (7 bars, 6 bars)

---

## Building Each Section

### The Intro

**Purpose:** Hook the listener, set the tone

**Options:**
| Type | Description | Use When |
|------|-------------|----------|
| Instrumental hook | Main riff/melody | Strong musical hook |
| Chorus preview | Teaser of chorus | Strong lyrical hook |
| Ambient/atmospheric | Build mood | Emotional songs |
| Straight to verse | No intro | Immediate story |
| Drum count-in | "1, 2, 3, 4" | Live/raw feel |

**Length:** Usually 4-8 bars. Don't wait too long.

### The Verse

**Purpose:** Set up the story, build toward chorus

**Characteristics:**
- Lower energy than chorus
- Develops narrative
- More detail/specifics
- Different melody than chorus
- Each verse reveals something new

**Verse 1 vs Verse 2:**
| Verse 1 | Verse 2 |
|---------|---------|
| Sets the scene | Develops/complicates |
| Introduces situation | Shows change/passage of time |
| First impression | Deeper insight |

### The Pre-Chorus

**Purpose:** Bridge verse to chorus, build anticipation

**Techniques:**
- Rising melody
- Building instrumentation
- Lyrics hint at chorus
- Harmonic tension
- Drum build/fills

**Length:** Usually 4-8 bars

### The Chorus

**Purpose:** Deliver the hook, emotional peak

**Characteristics:**
- Highest energy
- Most memorable melody
- Contains the title (usually)
- Repeats throughout song
- Simpler, more universal lyrics

**The chorus should:**
- Be immediately singable
- Contain the hook
- Feel like a release after verse tension

### The Bridge

**Purpose:** Provide contrast, new perspective

**Characteristics:**
- Musically different
- Often only appears once
- Can be highest or lowest energy
- New lyrical angle
- Breaks the pattern

**Bridge options:**
| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Breakdown | Strip down, quiet moment |
| Build-up | Escalate to final chorus |
| New melody | Completely different section |
| Instrumental | Solo or musical interlude |
| Key change | Shift to new key |

### The Outro

**Purpose:** Close the song satisfyingly

**Options:**
| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Fade out | Gradual volume decrease |
| Cold ending | Sudden stop |
| Tag | Repeat hook/phrase |
| Instrumental | Ride out on groove |
| Return to intro | Bookend structure |
| New moment | Surprise ending |

## Creating Contrast

### Why Contrast Matters

**No contrast = boring**

Contrast between sections creates:
- Interest and variety
- Sense of journey
- Emotional impact
- Memorability

### Types of Contrast

| Element | Verse | Chorus |
|---------|-------|--------|
| Energy | Lower | Higher |
| Dynamics | Quieter | Louder |
| Density | Fewer elements | More elements |
| Range | Lower/mid | Higher range |
| Lyric style | Story/detail | Universal/hook |
| Melody | More complex | Simpler, memorable |

### The Payoff Principle

**What you withhold creates the payoff:**
- Hold back drums → drums entering = impact
- Keep dynamics low → going loud = power
- Stay in lower range → high notes = emotion

---

## Dynamic Arc

### The Journey

Every song tells an emotional story:

**Start:** Establish (intro/verse 1)
**Build:** Develop (verses/pre-choruses)
**Peak:** Climax (final chorus/bridge)
**Resolve:** Close (outro)

### Energy Management

**Don't:**
- Start at maximum energy
- Stay at one level throughout
- Peak too early

**Do:**
- Build progressively
- Create valleys to make peaks bigger
- Save something for the end

### The Final Chorus

**Should be the biggest:**
- Additional instrumentation
- Extra vocal layers
- Higher key (optional modulation)
- Extended length
- Ad-libs/variations

---

## Section Transitions

### Making Sections Flow

**Transition techniques:**
| Technique | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Fill | Drum fill into new section |
| Crash | Cymbal on downbeat of new section |
| Drop out | Remove elements, then add back |
| Riser | White noise or synth sweep |
| Pickup | Vocal or melodic pickup into section |
| Silence | Brief pause before new section |
| Crossfade | Elements fade in as others fade out |

### Smooth vs. Surprising

**Smooth transitions:** Build and release naturally
**Surprising transitions:** Sudden changes, unexpected

**Both have their place.** Match to the song's needs.

## Non-Standard Structures

### Starting with Chorus

```
Chorus → Verse → Chorus → Verse → Chorus → Bridge → Chorus
```

**When to use:** When chorus is immediately compelling

### Double Verse

```
Verse 1 → Verse 2 → Chorus → Verse 3 → Chorus → Bridge → Chorus
```

**When to use:** Story-driven songs, building suspense

### No Bridge

```
Verse → Chorus → Verse → Chorus → Chorus → Outro
```

**When to use:** Simple, direct songs

### Extended Bridge/Breakdown

```
Verse → Chorus → Verse → Chorus → Long Bridge/Breakdown → Chorus → Outro
```

**When to use:** EDM, dance music, dramatic songs

## Planning Your Structure

### Before You Write

**Answer these questions:**
1. What's the overall vibe?
2. Where's the emotional peak?
3. What structure serves this song?
4. How long should it be?

### Structure Template

Use this to plan:

```
Section:  |____|____|____|____|____|____|____|____|
Name:     Intro  V1  Pre  Ch   V2   Pre  Ch   Br   Ch   Out
Bars:       4    8    4    8    8    4    8    8   16    4
Energy:     2    3    5    8    3    6    8    4   10    3
```
